## Foreword </div>
We've made this book in an attempt to bring the beloved Warcraft franchise into the 5th edition of D&D. It is a task that has taken us months to do, and it'll likely take many more still. Everyone involved are working this in their spare time, aiming to bring a genuine recreation of *Warcraft* as a D&D 5th Edition tabletop RPG.

This book is made to compliment official D&D 5th edition books, including the **Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide**, and **Monster Manual**. It has been built on the framework set by those books, and designed to be brought in as any supplement book would. Without any more work than to just use the material presented.

It has been written with the intention of always being a free resource for everyone to use. Never to be bought or paid for. We've made this because we want others to enjoy the Warcraft universe under D&D 5th Edition rules. Not for any monetary gain.

With each coming update, all changes will be noted in the Changelog — Link is provided below.

# Chapter 1: Races
Armies and factions have always defined the Warcraft world, and two of the most powerful factions on Azeroth today are the Alliance and Horde. Most players belong to one or the other faction, although anomalies do exist.

## Choosing a Side
At character creation, every player must choose their character’s faction. It is as much a part of the hero as their class or background. All characters in a party are usually of the same faction.

Although every race has an affiliation, there are excep-tions. Creating a character outside their normal affiliation is challenging, but offers a great role play opportunities for the player. Some suggestions are listed below.

 - The character was born into the faction.
 - The character was saved or befriended by members of the faction.
 - The character fled from their faction.
 - The character witnessed members of their faction doing something they found reprehensible.

## The Alliance
The Alliance have proven themselves to be fierce combatants, often giving their lives when called for. The faction is not a uniform governmental body, but is a coalition of mutual military and economic aid. Diplomacy is key with in the Alliance and decisions are traditionally made by being voted on by the Alliance's most influential members. Stormwind is described as the most powerful force in the now multiracial Alliance. With it becoming the de facto leader of the remaining human kingdoms and entering a powerful alliance with the strongest dwarven kingdom, Ironforge, Stormwind has thus been shown to be the most influential kingdom and therefore the de facto driving force of Alliance politics. Therefore, Stormwind is undisputedly looked to for maintaining the Alliance and its policies. Stormwind is where the main superpowers of the Alliance conference to discuss world issues and mutual defense. The majority of Alliance citizens also recognizes Stormwind City as the heart of the Alliance. The High King coordinates the workings of the Alliance's armies in order to safeguard the Alliance's interests and defense. 

Even now, as always, humans are the glue that hold the Alliance together, being the most numerous and diplomatic of the member races. The armies of Stormwind are primarily stationed in the southern Eastern Kingdoms, securing regions such as Elwynn Forest, Duskwood, Westfall, and the Redridge mountains. As well as having outposts and bases stationed at key points in Lordaeron, Northrend, and Kalimdor. The armies of Ironforge are mainly stationed in Khaz Modan along with their gnome allies, and the night elven armies are mainly defending &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;northern Kalimdor from the Horde's deforestation of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Ashenvale. The remaining draenei forces &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are still trying to secure their new home on &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azuremyst Isle, and are also stationed in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outland. The recently brought in Gil- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nean armies are defending them- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selves from the endless Forsaken.

## The Horde 
The Horde makes no compromises <br> when it comes to excellence, and the <br> power and ferocity of their warriors is <br> legendary. Misunderstood by many as <br> evil, the Horde possesses a strong code of <br> honor and strict laws for disobedience. <br> All members of the Horde have to swear a blood oath to join the faction and are thus obligated to follow the warchief's commands and support the warchief in war if the warchief calls upon them for aid. The position of warchief can be attained by having the previous warchief choose a successor or challenging the current warchief to a Mak'gora: a prearranged duel with deadly weapons between two people following a formal procedure in the presence of witnesses and traditionally fought until one party yields or is killed, usually to settle a quarrel involving a point of honor. Above all else, the title warchief is granted to those who display strength and decisive action.

The warchief may accept ambassadors and advisors from all the different tribes and members of the Horde to makes sure their voice is heard in the running of the fledgling hegemony but ultimately, only the warchief may have the final say in matters concerning the entire Horde. Each race within the Horde choose a single leader to govern their people and their people's kingdoms and also to represent their people in the high Horde echelon.

Despite their somewhat monstrous appearance, the majority of the Horde is not evil, much like the Alliance, it is comprised of diverse factions and individuals who possess a wide range of values and virtues. Even so, there is one expectation that must be met when joining the Horde: regardless of gender or station, all are expected to pull their own weight and give their talents for the betterment of the Horde. When weakness is a liability to the <br> of the Horde, it is the duty of the strong to <br> usurp control from the incompetent <br> and redeem the Horde. *Lok'tar ogar! <br> Victory or death* - These words bind <br> one to the Horde. For they are the <br> most sacred and fundamental of <br> truths to any warrior of the <br> Horde, for the Horde, failure <br> is not an option.

Culturally, orcs and tauren <br> believe in redemption more <br> than most other races on <br> Azeroth and are willing to <br> give almost anyone a chance, <br> regardless of reputation. The trolls <br> seem to have even accepted, (if not <br> at least tolerate) their ancient enemy <br> the blood elves. Largely because of <br> these beliefs, a number of mortal races <br> and many diverse factions can be found <br> in bservice to the Horde.

## Choosing a Race
A *visit to one of the great cities in the world of Azeroth Stormwind City, the Capital City of Stormwind, the City of Doors overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless dialects of different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants.*

*And the people themselves represent many different races, from gnomes and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful elves, mingling among a variety of humans.*

*Scattered among the common races: a draenei here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly worgen there, lurking in the shadows. Night elves and dwarves live and work alongside humans. And there, a lone pandaren — a wanderer from the shifting isles of the ever expanding great sea, trying to make his way in a world unknown.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— A poetic gnome* &nbsp;</div>

Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. The ones presented in this book are the races most well known to become adventurers and heroes, spread throughout every corner of Azeroth's continents.

Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character's adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a gnome could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic.

Your character race not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character's story. Each race's description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies.
<br>
These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their race. It's worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character's background and personality.

\columnbreak

### Racial Traits
The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.

#### Ability Score Increase
Every race increases one or more of a character's
ability scores.

#### Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race's expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game.

#### Alignment
Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.

#### Size
Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons.

#### Speed
Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling and fighting.

#### Languages
By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Each race has their own language, with multiple  dialects. as well as a 'common' language, that the majority of their faction speaks and understands. Chapter 4 lists languages commonly spoken on Azeroth.

#### Subraces
Many races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among the subraces vary significantly from race to race.

# Alliance Class Suggestions
</div>

The following are a set of class suggestions, pulled from World of Wacraft, as the classes the Alliance races will more than likely be. It is suggested that you pick from among your race's suggested classes to keep with the thematic elements of the setting. That said, heroes are meant to break molds and be the exception to rules, so feel free to pick a class that is not typically used by your race. If you do pick outside your racial classes though, work with your Dungeon Master to create a backstory for why you are a member of this class. 

You will likely notice that there are two class suggestion charts. One for Pre-Cataclysm, and one for Post-Cataclysm. This was done because the Cataclysm is a major turning point in the history of Azeroth, and the races of the Alliance began learning new abilities and sources of power, in order to fight back against the threats that assail their world. Prior to the Cataclysm, the Alliance races were less open to sharing knowledge of and learning about new classes and tended to stay within the traditional classes of their race.

## Human
*No one feels he deserves it. Because no one does. It's grace, pure and simple, we are inherently unworthy, simply because we're human. Aye the elves, dwarves, and all the other races are flawed. But the Light loves us anyway. It loves us for what we sometimes can rise to in rare moments. It loves us for what we can do to help others.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Uther the Lightbringer* &nbsp;</div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

Human kingdoms have existed for thousand of years, and humans themselves for thousands more. Their short lives in comparison to dwarves and elves pushes them to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Their valor, optimism, and stubbornness have led them to build some of the greatest kingdoms on Azeroth, some of which still stand a millennium later. Whatever have pushed them down, it has only strengthened the bond between those that still stand.

### A Broad Spectrum
With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than any other race. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:542px'></div>

### Variety in All Things
Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among Azeroth's races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different kingdoms where they have settled. When they settle though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human's memory. They live fully in the present but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy.

### Proudly Standing
Despite what atrocities have happened to them, humans remain hardy and brave, thoroughly committed to building strong societies, reinforcing their kingdoms, and reclaiming lost nations. Years of war have tempered their resolve, and they are more determined than ever before. Their value of virtue, honor and courage shine their ranks.

### Faithful
Among all human nations, the holy light is a central part of civilized society. By most it is considered the only religion and a staple of worship, respect, and honor. The religion is widely worshiped throughout Azeroth, yet humans were the first to utilize its powers in an offensive manner with the creation of paladins. Throughout their kingdoms, churches of the holy light can be found, an organization dedicated to creating a world of honor, and justice.

### Affiliation
Humans began the Alliance and it could not exist without them. Humans and orcs joined forces to face the Burning Legion years ago, but old habits returned once they dispatched the demon threat. Although the Alliance and Horde leaders bear a healthy respect for each another, old racial hatreds still stir within the hearts of their troops. 

They respect the races of their alliance, and carries no ill wish against any of them. They know they are the center stone of the alliance, and that a good relationship is key.

### Human Names and Ethnicities
Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarven or Darnassian, but most parents give names that are linked to their region's culture or to the naming traditions of their ancestors.

The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region. For example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in the peninsula of Gilneas than in the southern kingdom of Stormwind. Human physical characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Eastern Kingdoms have every possible variation of coloration and features.

Seven human kingdoms and ethnic groups are widely recognized. These groups, and the typical names of their members, can be used as inspiration no matter which kingdom your human is in.

#### Alterac
Found in the Alterac mountains, Alteracis are of moderate height and muscular built, with skin hues of pale and fair skin. Their hair is usually silver or blonde, and their eye color varies widely, though light colorations are common.

### Human Traits
It's hard to make generalizations about humans, no matter where you were born your character has these traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** One ability score of your choice increases by 2, and another ability score of your choice increases by 1.

***Age.*** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.

***Size.*** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall, averaging at 170 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 

***Versatility.*** You gain proficiency in one skill or tool of your choice.

***Human Resolve.*** When you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can do so with advantage. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Dwarven curses, Darnassian musical expressions, Gnomish tongue twisters, and so on.

### A Reclaimed Legacy
The undiscovered fragments of their past have led the dwarves on an unprecedented exodus of of exploration to seek out their origins. Seeking out their origins, the dwarves have dispatched prospectors across all of Lordaeron in order to seek out signs of the Titans, the supposed creators of the dwarves. The dwarves have embraced the idea that it is their purpose to search the world for more signs of proof of their heritage. Dwarven outposts exist in the most desolate of places on Azeroth. 

Here, the dwarves spend their time seeking out the secrets of ancient times, or simply use their outposts as staging grounds for expeditions to clear out their enemies so that they may continue their quest.

### Short and Stout
Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.

Dwarves skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. With their dark iron kin having notably darker skin of gray to coal-black. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though wildhammer dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.

### Innovative
Dwarves are a proud, stern and determined people with streaks of kindness hidden under the gruff exteriors of their sturdy frames. Their love for battle, invention and exploration impels them ever forward to discover and unearth the mysteries of their heritage, educating them further about those who first created the dwarven race.

Only recently have the dwarves discovered the legacy of their ancient progenitors, the Titans. As the dwarves begin to delve deeper into the mysteries of their past, they also begin to uncover deeper enigmas. 

Still, they keep to the forges and workshops, ever inno-vating and creating new and more effective ways of warfare. Steam powered technology and firearms originate from dwarven inventiveness and creativity. The stout race is renowned for its skills at battle and also as cunning engineers and crafters.

### Affiliation 
Dwarves are part of the alliance. While the dwarves of Khaz Modan appreciate the fighting skill of the Horde, it is with grim eyes that they look upon the orcs and their allies, the trolls and the Forsaken. Although the dwarves have held dealings of commerce and diplomacy with the blood elves, they keep the people of Quel’Thalas at an arm’s distance. While the darnassian elves may share the same allegiances, the dwarves look upon them with suspicion and some trepidation.

Humans, however, are the staunch and constant allies of the dwarven people and find welcome, favor and kindness when in dwarven lands.

### Names
Dwarves typically have names reflecting the sturdy nature of their past. Many also have surnames that were earned by a member of the family in service during a quest or in a particular moment of notoriety or infamy that has now become part of a family legacy.

## Night Elf
*Darkness covered us in the beginning, and we could not see. We cried for guidance and the moon shone down bright upon us. Her soft light not only illuminated the night for us but also gave comfort.
<br>Her light touched us from within, enabling us to see even when the moon was not visible...*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Tyrande Whisperwind* &nbsp;</div>

Proud and ancient, the kaldorei once ruled Azeroth as one powerful nation. They were the first to study magic and let it loose throughout the world during the First war. Since then most night elves have abandoned arcane, remember-ing the chaos it brought, turning their attention to raw strength, or the powers of nature.

### Graceful Nature
Imposing in stature, night elves stand as one of the highest race of elves and on Azeroth, with their muscular bodies and slender builds, and long narrow ears. Their skin range in hues of blue, from a light blue sky to the deep blue of the water. With hair varying from a lush green, to blue, to dark purple. It is customary among night elves to paint tattoos across their faces, generally depicting an animal or leaf like design, often done as a rite of passage to adulthood. 

Their eyes shine with a dim golden or silver glow, since the Sundering the golden glow has become ever more common amongst the night elves, a sign of their connection to nature and druidsm. Night elves who's eyes shine silver have left their kins ways for the arcane, and is seen as an outcast by most night elves.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:520px;'></div>

### Belief in the Ancients
Night elves have made close ties to the ancients beings of Azeroth. They have a strong connection to the goddess Elune and have built temples and organizations in her name to carry on her message. The sisters of Elune have long since been the leaders of the night elven military, and official head of their civilization as a whole.

Although Elune stands above all else, the night elves also carry a deep respect and gratitude to the ancient guardians of Azeroth, also know as wild gods, many of whom have not been seen since the blessing of nordrassil. Was it not for their aid during the War of the Ancients, the night elves would have perished from the surface of Azeroth.

### A Timeless Perspective
Night Elves can live to become thousands of years of age, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are often more amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, whether adven-turing on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them.

Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compro-mise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, strategy, and the foces of nature.

### Affiliation
Night elves joined the alliance after the Third War. The war had cost the elves many of their former allies, who had fallen into madness and abandoned the alliance they had with the night elves. the night elves have a disgust and suspicion of the high elves. They remember the atrocities their forefathers the highborne did, and have not forgiven them for it. Despite the grudge, they have worked together in the past when it was deemed a necessity for survival.

Even though much of the kaldorei nation has joined the Alliance, many among them have chosen to stay neutral. Night elves of the Cenarion Circle, for example, choose to stay out of the faction conflict, and turned their attention towards the protection of Azeroth's nature.

### Night Elf Names
Kaldorei names commonly have a hidden meaning or a meaning in Darnassian, and their surnames aren family names, derived from personal feats of the night elves ancestors, yet some amongst night elves take new family names showing their own achievements.

## Gnome
*You never really understood, did you? It is our loyalty to our friends that provides our truest, greatest strength... <br> My friends. It is a power that numbers cannot match.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Gelbin Mekkatorque* &nbsp;</div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

Gnomes are a diminutive, wiry race of tinkers who live underground. In the Second War, they built vehicles and gadgets for the Alliance, submarines and flying machines, to combat the Horde. They are great mechanics and inventors, and are renowned for their knowledge and eccentric natures. The gnomes had a city, Gnomeregan, built into Ironforge Mountain. But invading troggs destroyed it and slaughtered its citizens.

Many survivors moved into Khaz Modan and now live with the Dun Morogh dwarves, and a few traveled with their dwarven friends to Kalimdor. 

The gnomes are still reeling from the destruction of their home city and are loath to leave the safety of the dwarven tunnels. Most gnomes on Kalimdor remain secluded in Bael Modan.

### Cheerful Expression
Even after the decimation of their race and the destruction of their city, gnomes are an amiable and kind hearted lot. They make and keep friends easily; others find disliking a gnome to be difficult. A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome's insatiable interest in everything around.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:600px'></div>

A gnome's personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome's beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome's clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.

### Exceptional Tinkers
Gnomes tend to design complicated devices that are relatively safe. Gnomes are in many ways commensurate organizers: a gnome can spend as much time organizing and planning a project as they do actually working on it. If the design fails, they try to learn why, and fix it if they can. 

If they meet with success, they will continue to tinker with it and improve the design, often for years afterward. Thus, many gnomish designs feature a high degree of complexity and a low chance of failure, the exceptions being those that dabble with chaos energy — but even then, they take steps to ensure the worst that could happen is a brief, non-fatal failure.

While a goblin would scream and flee at the mere thought of a cost overrun, a gnome simply shrugs and presses on. If a project fails to work correctly the first time, a gnome will continue to tinker with it, while a goblin would usually give up and move to something else. Thus, gnomish items have very low failure rates compared to goblin items.

### Affiliation
Gnomes are members of the alliance, they are great friends of the dwarves and have fought and died alongside human soldiers. They are wary of the blood elves, but so is everyone else, so they don’t feel too bad about that. They battled the Horde in the Second
War and have a bit of a grudge against orcs, but gnomes are a kindly and forgiving lot and are willing to give the orcs a second chance. Gnomes and goblins have always been rivals — though whether this rivalry is friendly or brutal depends on the individuals involved.

Gnomes have not been on Kalimdor long enough to form proper opinions about its denizens. Tauren and night elves both seem rather rustic for gnome sensibilities — but they can make friends with anyone.

### Names
Gnome parents name their children at birth. Gnomes have family names that represent an honored ancestor’s achievements, but they only keep these names until some time in their 30s. Gnome society expects them to have made their own achievements by then, and thus the gnome invents a new name that represents their own accomplish-ments. This name then takes the place of his family name.

***Gnome Cunning.*** You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.

The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.

When you create a device, choose one of the following:

 - *Clockwork Toy.* This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.
 - *Fire Starter.* The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.
 - *Music Box.* When opened. this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. Gnomish in many ways look like dwarven, it uses the same script, and is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.

## Draenei
*In moments of great strife, I gaze into the heavens and see just how far we have already come.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Prophet Velen* &nbsp;</div>

Thousands of years ago, the titan Sargeras shattered the tranquility of Argus by offering the eredar immeasurable knowledge and power. The eredar were a knowledge-seeking race and accepted his offer. He bathed them in his fel might, turning them into demonic beings of the burning legion called Man'ari. The prophet Velen got a troubling vision of what his race would become, and fled Argus with his followers by the help of the divine Naaru, who renamed them draenei, or "Exiled Ones" in the common tongue.

The draenei refer to their corrupted brethren as man'ari, meaning "Unnatural Being". Although both originate from the eredar race, neither the draenei or man'ari consider themselves eredars anymore.

### Alien Appearance
While they stand tall and proud, they resemble no other race on Azeroth. Their skin ranges from rose white, to dark violet colors. They stand slightly taller than humans on average, ranging from well over 6 feet tall to just over 8 feet. They are generally more muscular than other races, with double jointed legs ending in hooves, weighing 250 pounds or more. Males and females are about the same height, and male are only marginally heavier than females.

Both genders have tendrils in their head as part of their hair or beard, and both have horns, it is common though for females to have drastically larger horns than males. They also have slender tails, males being considerably longer and thicker than females.

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:390px'></div>

Broken draenei, although having many of their pure kins features have noticeable differences, their faces are less structured, and appear more flat than their kins beautiful features. They stand shorter than exodar draenei, their skin hard and cracked like stone, appearing more human than exodar draenei with single jointed legs.

### The Divine Naaru
During the draenei's journey, the enigmatic naaru race taught them the ways of the light, though they already had a certain experience with it through Velen and T'uure. The naaru explained that there were other forces in the cosmos that would stand against the Burning Legion.

The naaru bestowed a blessing, the Gift of the Naaru, upon the draenei to signify their new connection the light. Deeply affected by the naaru's words, the draenei vowed to honor the it and uphold the naaru's ideals.

### Affiliation
Due to the draenei's friendly and honorable attitude, they tend to get along well with other races, especially those who belong to the Alliance who welcomed them into their allegiance, even though not all races return their kindness. Draenei have very strong ties with the night elves, who were the first of the Alliance to greet the draenei and welcome them.

Draenei hate orcs for the kins actions on Draenor, leading to a large distrust from the draenei side of the horde and its allied races.

### Names 
Draenei, unlike most races, do not have last names. Their parents give them a name at their birth. Upon a draenei reaching adulthood they choose a name for themselves that they keep for the rest of their life.

## Worgen
*When I told you that I wanted to retake Gilneas City from these Forsaken. There were those who said that it was impossible. I say that we no longer let our fears control us! For too long it has controlled me, fear that if all of you knew the whole truth, you would reject me. I give in no longer. Look at me... Now that you know the truth, I ask of you, who will stand with me, who will fight by my side?*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Genn Greymane* &nbsp;</div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

Worgens are vicious humanoid wolves, a curse thrown upon them by careless druids mingling in powers that were beyond them. The druids turned into the first worgen, feral and uncontrollable, they were sealed away for countless years when night elves realized that their bite was able to transfer the curse to others.

When the forsaken sieged the kingdom of Gilneas, the worgens were released from their imprisonment to fight the undead. The feral worgens were effective, but did not differentiate undead from human. The feral worgens never entered Gilneas, but the humans did. Spreading the curse through the kingdom like wildfire. Realizing their mistake, the night elves came to gilneas rescue to offer their aid, they evacuated as many people as they could, and sailed them to their homeland in Teldrassil. There, night elven druids taught the gilnean people how to control the feral curse that lingered in their veins. Some gilneas were so fascinated by the elves magic and connection to druidism, that they were taught their ways.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:434px'></div>

### Fierce and Vicious
With their massive shapes of a cross between a human and wolf, and the razor sharp claws, worgens appear like evil of a children's tale to those unaware of their existence. They loom over the heads of humans, ranging well over 6 feet to just under 8 feet. Their furry bodies often make them seem much larger than they are, yet with their massive bodies they weigh between 220 to 310 pounds. Males and females are about the same height and build, with the only distinct difference being a males mane.

Worgen fur varies widely in coloration, with shades of black, gray, and brown being the most common amongst the worgen kin, even if the worgen had light colorations in skin or hair as a human. Worgen eyes vary like humans, from a light blue to a deep brown.

### More than just Ferocious
With their wild appearance it is easy to think of a worgen as a vicious beast. Yet most still carries the properties they had in their human life. The curse will always linger in their blood, giving many worgen's a shorter temper than they might've had before. Yet they carry the same compas-sion and determination as humans do, pushing themselves forward to achieve ever greater things for themselves, their newfound kin and that of the human.

### Affiliation
Worgens are still humans at their cores, they began the Alliance and it could not exist without them. Besides the respect given to all affiliated races, the gilnean humans carry a great gratitude for night elves. Their curse may be the result of rogue night elven druids, but without their aid the worgens would still be feral and hostile to all.

Although no one trusts or likes the forsaken, the gilnean hatred of the undead goes deeper than most. The forsaken are the cause of their kingdoms demise, a fact the worgens have and will not forget.

### Worgen Traits
The worgen curse has transformed your body into that of a worgen, giving you the following traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength increases by 2, and your Dexterity increases by 1.

***Age.*** Worgen age like humans, but even though their bodies continue to age, they never feel the strain of old age, and continue to fight as if they were a young human. 

***Alignment.*** Worgen tend to become chaotic, while originating from humans, the infection of their blood with the wolves has made them more unpredictable.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet

***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to the black nights, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects.

***Two Forms.*** Using 1 minute, you can transform yourself into a human. While human, you appear as you did before getting affected by the worgen curse. You always appear as the same human when you transform. You can transform back into a worgen as a free action on your turn.

As a human, you loose all worgen form traits. If you make an attack, cast a spell that affects an enemy creature, or try to use an ability only available in worgen form, you imme-diately revert into your worgen form.

## Void Elf
*Some will tell you that the Light is the only path. The one weapon that can stop the enemies of Azeroth. But we see alternatives. Many roads -- many possibilities -- that are open to us. There will be those who doubt you. Who question your resolve, your ability to harness powers that have caused the downfall of weaker wills.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Alleria Windrunner* &nbsp;</div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

Infused by the void itself, the Ren'dorei -- children of the void -- are a group of blood elves exiled from their home-land of Quel'Thalas. Cast out for their teachings at the hand of the elven magister Umbric, the elves have embr-aced their newfound powers, though the inner turmoil it has caused may well follow them through their lives as they fight to maintain control over it.

### Shaped by the Void
While they are of the same blood as their elven siblings, void elves are best recognized for their pale or vibrant, blue-tinged skin and eyes. As well as the deep shades of blue and purple in their shadow-infused hair.

For some void elves, their dark powers can be seen manifesting in their hair, leaving the tips shimmering with void energy.

Most who have tried to harness the corruptive powers of the void have fallen into madness. Among mortals, former ranger-general Alleria Windrunner stands as the first to properly wield it -- the elf now using her powers to guide her elven kin alongside the magister Umbric.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:554px'></div>

The void elves aim, above all, to use their dangerous powers to defend both the Alliance and Azeroth itself. In doing so, they seek to prove wrong any who would doubt or judge their abilities.

### Exiled From Home
Originally, the void elves were the pupils and followers of Umbric -- a magister at the court of Silvermoon, who thought the void to be the key to the survival of Quel'Thalas after its destruction at the hands of the undead Scourge.

However, the other magisters did not agree. Least of all the Grand Magister, who ultimately banished the elves from the land under fear that the void would pose great dangers to the kingdom and to the Sunwell. 

Now, emboldened by their newfound powers, the void elves have sworn to make their claim on the world, under the joint leadership of magister Umbric and Alleria Windrunner. 

> ##### Emergence of the Void Elves
> The Ren'dorei are specific group of void elves, following the teachings of magister Umbric, though he is not the first elf to have dabbled with the void. If your group aims to run an adventure set before the Burning Legion's defeat at Argus, you should work with your DM to determine the source of your transformative powers.

### Affiliation
Following their exile from Quel'Thalas by their elven kin, the Ren'dorei have decided to swear themselves to the service of the Alliance, under the guidance of former ranger-general Alleria Windrunner. 

The elves, with little love or care now for their blood elven kin, choose to embrace or try to forget their status as outcasts -- for they will forever be unwelcome within the land they've left behind.

### Names 
As the void elves are a small, exiled group of blood elves transformed by the void, their names flow similar to their blood elven kin -- with some choosing to change theirs to further embrace their new powers.

<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

**Male Names:** Mariel, Athaniar, Anador, Tharama, Viridiel, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malanior, Eraeth, Ulorath, Yehru, Kithadre
<br>**Female Names:** Anarial, Freja, Driana, Coria, Alanassori, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melanion, Azshara, Curlih, Setori, Amorly, Zama
<br>**Surnames:** Coldtrail, Nightfeast, Voidworn, Morncloud, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duskblood, Darkvein, Gloomwalker, Voidheart

### Void Elf Traits
Your elf character has few natural abilities that are shared amongst all of the elven kin.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 1, your Constitution score increases by 1, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Void elves reach adulthood at the rate of humans, but are not considered to have entered adulthood until they reach 60, and can live to become many hundreds of years old with ease. That said, many of the void elves have lived for thousands of years due to the power of the Sunwell extending their lifespan.

***Alignment.*** Most void elves tend to be lawful, much like their blood elven kin. Those who do become chaotic are those who lose control of their void powers and become consumed by them.

***Size.*** Void elves in many ways resemble humans, but with slender builds, and much more refined features. Usually just over 6 feet tall, with very little difference between male and females. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Keen Senses.*** You are proficient in the Perception skill.

***Chill of Night.*** You have resistance to Necrotic damage.

***Spatial Rift.*** As a bonus action, you can open a rift in space and time to an unoccupied space you can see, within 30 feet of your current position. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all damage when you go through the the spatial rift. The resist-ance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you are enveloped in void energy.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Thalassian. Thalassian is a derivative of the Darnassian language, and in many ways sound the same to an inexperienced ear.

# Horde Class Suggestions
</div>

The following are a set of class suggestions, pulled from World of Wacraft, as the classes the Horde races will more than likely be. It is suggested that you pick from among your race's suggested classes to keep with the thematic elements of the setting. That said, heroes are meant to break molds and be the exception to rules, so feel free to pick a class that is not typically used by your race. If you do pick outside your racial classes though, work with your Dungeon Master to create a backstory for why you are a member of this class. 

You will likely notice that there are two class suggestion charts. One for Pre-Cataclysm, and one for Post-Cataclysm. This was done because the Cataclysm is a major turning point in the history of Azeroth, and the races of the Horde began learning new abilities and sources of power, in order to fight back against the threats that assail their world. Prior to the Cataclysm, the Horde races were less open to sharing knowledge of and learning about new classes and tended to stay within the traditional classes of their race.

## Orc
*To pretend the demonic corruption did not exist is to forget how dreadful the impact was. To make ourselves into victims, rather than claiming our participation in our own destruction. We chose this path, we orcs. We chose it right up until it was too late to turn back. And having made that choice, we can, with the knowledge that we have of the end of that dark and shameful road, choose not to take it.*

### Introduction
When the orcs were freed from the Burning Legion, they experienced a spiritual revolution as the unnatural bloodlust left their bodies, connecting them with states of heart and mind that were common to their ancestors. This new generation of orcs for the most part followed Thrall as he forged to reform the Horde through shamanism and tribal tradition.

Though prone to fits of rage in warfare, orcs tend to display a curious feral grace that can rival even the finest fencing of an elven noble. The orcs of today continue to stand in drastic contrast to those that were enslaved by the Burning Legion, who embodied a bestial and diabolical force which was barely being controlled by warlock magic.

### Mindful Race
To orcs, prowess in battle bestows great personal honor on an individual. This notion of honor pervades every echelon of orcish culture, and the loss or gain of honor has equal consequence to all orcs regardless of their stature in society. 

Even the naming of orcs is temporary until they have performed rites of passage; only when orcs bring honor to themselves and thus to their clan do elders grant them adult names based upon their deeds. Orcs may appear quick to anger but they are tempered by the wisdom of the shamans, who are revered across Horde society.

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:369px'></div>

While many in the Alliance still perceive the orcs as brutish or even mindless, they have forged a complex culture embracing many occupations and many different races. No doubt Thrall's leadership aided in bringing this about, yet it is apparent that the Alliance has underestimated the orcs' ability to construct a society that is highly influential in world affairs.

### Spiritual
As far back as orcish history has been recorded, shaman have been mentioned, and learning to speak with the elemental spirits of Draenor was a pivotal achievement in destiny for the orc clans. The first orcs to learn the ways of shamanism hailed from the Shadowmoon clan, but many clans claim the mythical "First Shaman" arose from their ranks, even though the truth is that no one is sure of his or her allegiance.

Several orc shaman worship or at least acknowledge the Earth Mother, the benevolent creator deity primarily worshipped by the tauren.

### Frightful Appearance
Orc males are massive and brutish looking creatures. Weighing in at 250 to 300 pounds and standing from 6 to 7 feet in height, they are not a small race. Even orc women tend to be only a half-foot or so shorter than most males, having broad shoulders and muscular, powerful bodies.

Orcs tend to have bristly hair and beards, often black or brown in color. Their skin ranges from a light green to a dark drab olive. Eyes range in color from a fierce red to a pale blue. Orcs have broad, flat noses, tusk-like teeth jutting from their lower and sometimes upper jaws, and large, pointed ears. They favor clothes of hide, and armor and arm themselves with a variety of gear.

### Affiliation
Thrall formed the Horde with determination and sheer will, and created an alliance of races that has shaken the foundations of the world to its core. Having destroyed the legacy of Grom Hellscream by bringing the orcs out of the depths of demon worship and servitude to unseen powers.

### Names
Most orcish names derive from words in their language that have some complex meaning or hidden significance to their families. Typically, this is the name of a favorite thing or relative. Family names don’t exist; most orcs have last names related to some great deed of heroism or honor.

## Forsaken
*Death offered no escape for the scores of humans killed during the Lich King’s campaign to scour the living from Lordaeron. Instead, the kingdom’s fallen were risen into undeath as Scourge minions and forced to wage an unholy war against everything. . . and everyone. . . that they once held dear.*

### Introduction
Undead humans and elves freed from the Lich King’s control, the Forsaken are a strange and dark force. Hailing from the twisted, skittering darkness of Undercity, the Forsaken are nominally allied with the Horde but serve only themselves.

Under the Lich Kings crusade, the elven Ranger General Sylvanas Windrunner fell in combat. Prince Arthas raised her as a banshee and compelled her to follow his command. When the Lich King’s power waned in the incidents surrounding the Frozen Throne, Sylvanas harnessed her fury and tore herself free from his skeletal grasp. She freed many other undead as well, and recruited powerful allies from the Burning Legion and the surrounding ogre clans. Sylvanas dubbed her new force the Forsaken, and the undead established their capital in the labyrinthine crypts beneath Lordaeron’s capital city. Their sprawling, subterranean realm now called Undercity.

### Necessary Alliance
The Forsaken originally became allies of the Horde out of necessity and convenience. They have no love for orcs, tauren or any other living creature, but they need time to strike against the Scourge and allies to help them do it. The Forsaken claim that they joined the Horde to prove their desire to leave their evil ways behind, but no one really believes this. The Horde accepts the forsaken’s help, as they do indeed have a common enemy: the Scourge. The Horde is leery of the forsaken’s tactics, however, and keeps watchful eyes on them.

Though initially the Forsaken alliance with the Horde was one of pure convenience, in recent times it appears that their position in the faction has begun to solidify and many, though not all, of the Forsaken appear to be more or less loyal to the Horde now.

<div style='margin-top:545px'></div>

### Strange Behaviors
Forsaken culture is strange, a perverse combination of the lives they once knew as mortals and the mindless slavery they experienced in the Scourge, colored by white-hot rage toward the Lich King and an almost equally intense devotion to their queen. 

Some Forsaken attempt to reclaim their humanity by acting in kind and helpful ways. Others allow hatred to fester into cruelty and rage.

### Extreme Alchemists
Never sleeping, eating or falling ill, abandoned by those they once loved, the Forsaken have a brutal set of priorities. 

A great portion of their efforts focus on dark alchemy, and the Royal Apothecary Society commands great power in Undercity’s oily tunnels. The apothecaries constantly send Forsaken on missions to gather odd materials for their twisted experiments. Rumors tell that the undead creatures are working to create a plague that will exterminate the Scourge and every living being on Azeroth.

### Dreadful Looks
Forsaken, unsurprisingly, look like dead people. Their skin is gray and rotting, showing bone and flesh in places. Their pupil-less eyes glow with dim, white ghostlight. Their muscles are withered, making them scrawny. Their move-ments are slow but jagged. Necromantic magic keeps them preserved, but natural decay still proceeds, just at an extremely slow rate compared to normal.

### Affiliation
Though the Forsaken do not trust anyone and no one trusts them, they are members of the Horde and, for now, do their best to help their allies and placate their ambassadors. Forsaken have even less love for the Alliance, particularly because they clash constantly with the human organization called the Scarlet Crusade.

The only other Horde faction they have a semblance of trust with is Silvermoon City and the blood elves. This is because their ruler Sylvanas Windrunner, and a small portion of forsaken were once blood elves.

### Names
Most forsaken keep the human or blood elven name they had when they were alive. If a forsaken cannot remember their name, or simply wishes to change it, they make up a suitable name or read one from a headstone. Some invent surnames that imply their desire to eradicate the Scourge or about their undead nature.

### Forsaken Traits

## Tauren
*Our people have walked this land for many, many years, and in that time have learned much about the world. Our allies will need to look to us for wisdom and guidance. My father once made a promise to the Horde, to repay a debt we owed them for their service to our race. I, for one, intend to deliver on that promise.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— High Chieftain Baine Bloodhoof* &nbsp;</div>

### Introduction
The plains of Kalimdor have long been a home to these gargantuan nomads. The tauren are a race of spiritual shamans, hunters, and fighters, who long ago developed a complex culture and system of living without the aid of stonework, steel or conquest. This is not to say that the tauren are a race of pacifists, when they are angered they are capable of retaliating with swift and decisive brutality. 

The tauren are a noble race that embrace the natural world. They have shed their nomadic roots and united in their ancestral lands. Their race may be one of spirituality, reverence for nature, and respect for elders, but it also possesses powerful warriors that willingly fight when the situation demands it. Although strong and capable warriors when roused in battle, most tauren reserve combat for when all other options are exhausted. 

They prefer course of wise discussion and careful rumination before embarking on any great endeavor, and they have great respect for the wise, spiritual and elderly among their people. The tauren are not wrathful by nature, but sometimes a thirst for justice causes them to take up arms in anger. 

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:378px'></div>

### Peaceful Race
Tauren have no love for bloodshed, as their deep spiritual beliefs do not have a place for warfare. The elders of a tribe solve most issues, or two tauren might resolve a conflict with a ritual challenge resembling a duel. 

Having become members of the Horde, the introspective race has been involved in more and more conflict, creating a demand for tauren warriors and healers. Many must spend time putting great thought into the actions they perform on the field of battle. Taking another life, whether it is man or beast, is an act filled with great significance and responsibility to the tauren.

### Majestic Appearance
Tauren are large, and muscular with bull-like heads. Males average 7 1/2 feet tall and 400 pounds, while females are usually a bit shorter and lighter. Tauren are mostly muscle, having incredibly developed physiques and brawny frames most suitable for combat. Soft, downy fur covers the tauren body, with manes growing along head and neck, the lengths of the arms, and the shins.

Coloration can range from solid black to blond and even to white, or mottled pelts with a range of spots and different colors. Horns are most prominent on males, although all tauren have horns.

### Affiliation
Tauren are members of the horde. When they first encountered the orcs, the tauren recognized them as spiritual brethrens. No other race shared such a similar outlook on the world, and the shamans of both races met frequently to discuss the matters of the spirit world. The tauren allied with the orcs out of a shared vision, one of a collective of allies keeping each other well guarded. 

While the tauren see the orcs and trolls as friends to welcome, they rarely trust the forsaken with more than a nod and a place to set their withered feet, and give blood elves the same treatment, the taint of magic still lingering on the blood elven spirit is a poisonous air to the tauren, a stench of the soul that they cannot tolerate for long.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tauren bear no personal ill will to members of the Alliance unless directly threatened by them. They view night elves with awe and fear. Tauren and night elves have coexisted on Kalimdor for centuries, and tauren have long seen the Kaldorei as a mythical race of demigods, wielders of great magic and steeped in natural powers.

### Names 
The language of the tauren is often harsh and low sounding, which is reflected in the names of their children. The last name of a tauren is usually a family name, handed down through the generations. If the tauren has performed some act that has made an impression on the elders of his tribe, however, he may choose to take on his own last name to commemorate that act.

## Troll
*Your ancestry dates back to the dawn of the world. Great were the ancient empires of the trolls. I see a spark in your eyes, a powerful will - you wish to be great again, yes?* 
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Lorewalker Cho* &nbsp;</div>

### Introduction
The jungle trolls are sometimes referred to as Gurubashi trolls, after the ancient empire of the same name. Their capital, Zul'Gurub, is located in Stranglethorn Vale, along with many smaller towns, cities, and villages, many of which are in a state of ruin or disrepair. The largest jungle troll settlement outside Stranglethorn is Sen'jin Village founded by the Darkspear tribe, who had been displaced from their exile on the Broken Isles and Echo Isles.

Forest trolls hold all other races in contempt — especially blood elves, whom they consider the despoilers of their ancient homeland. They will only work with others if it means the elimination of an even more hated enemy. Forest troll culture is tribal and primitive. Though not as violent as their ice troll cousins, forest trolls nonetheless have a fearsome reputation in battle.

Ice trolls are a subspecies of troll that lives in cold climates. They have angular features, bright blue eyes, and mottled blue-white skin covered in hides and pelts. This troll has blue-white skin under grayish leather armor, and he sports a red mohawk. 

Ice trolls are generally evil and like most trolls, they are fierce protectors of their homes and may attack travelers to gain weapons, materials, clothing and food. They practice cannibalism and sometimes eat their slain enemies raw.

### Cannibalists and Voodooism
Cannibalism was a relatively common practice amongst trolls, although through the decades, and with their integration into the horde, their cannibalism had been frowned upon by most, and has since been made a forbidding practice by the horde, some still practice it, but non do so openly.

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:550px'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all trolls practice voodoo, but it is widespread. It was given to the trolls by their worshiped gods the Loa, and the exact emergence of voodoo among the trolls is unknown, for most tribes that possess such knowledge are unwilling to share it with outsiders.

### Tall and Muscular
Trolls are often tall, lanky, and muscular. They have both elven and orcish characteristics with their fierce fangs and long ears. Their long arms, strong legs and quick reflexes make them adept hunters. 

Trolls have only two fingers and a thumb on their hands, and they have only two toes on each foot. Some trolls have a toenail on their heels, and they do not wear standard shoes or boots due to their unusual foot shape and comfort in wading barefooted within different terrains.

### Affiliation
Trolls are steadfast members of the horde. Though they practice voodoo and many retain their savage natures, they are respected within the horde by the orcs. They feel a great debt to them, and their time fighting alongside the tauren has made them friends of these creatures as well. They are suspicious of the forsaken, but so is everyone else.

The troll tribes doesn’t really hate the Alliance races, but their loyalty to the Horde and their bloodthirstiness makes the Alliance a great target. However, their respect for the Warchief prevents them from waging a private war against Theramore.

### Names 
Troll names look simple but are surprisingly complex. Their language is largely syllabic, and various syllables can be added to the beginning or end of a troll’s name to denote status and ability. Trolls don't have family names, although some use their clan name as their surname.

## Blood Elf
*We must put this misery behind us. We must enter a new chapter! And so I say to you that, as of this day, we are no longer high elves! In honor of the sacrifices of our brothers and sisters, our parents, and our children, as of this day we will take the name of our royal lineage! As of this day, we are sin'dorei! For Quel'Thalas!*

<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Kael'thas Sunstrider* &nbsp;</div>

Nourished and strengthened by the Sunwell’s potent energies, the high elves’ enchanted kingdom of Quel'Thalas prospered within the verdant forests north of Lordaeron. 

During the Third War, the high elves were nearly scoured from Azeroth. Led by the death knight Arthas, the scourge army slaughtered almost all of the kingdom’s population. In the slaughter, Arthas tainted the sunwell, reanimating a lost necromancer. Prince Kael'thas rushed to his homeland's aid, and the survivors of the onslaught were renamed 'blood elves' in honor of their fallen kin. The blood elves grew addicted to the sunwells tainted energies. Kael'thas desperately searching for a cure for his kin, traveling the world to avenge his people and find a way to sate their hunger for magic.

Kael'thas assured his people he would return to Quel'Thalas and lead them to paradise, yet on Outland, the prince became twisted with the corrupting essence wielded by the demonic Burning Legion. Getting under the sway of the Legion's commander. The prince was later killed on his return to Quel'Thalas for his treachery, and with the aid of the draenei prophet, Velen, the magic taint lingering on the sunwell was vanquished, restore it as a fount of both arcane and holy energy.

Inspired by the Sunwell's rebirth, the blood elves have since entered into a shining new era in their ancient race's history. Although some elves remain hesitant to abandon their dependence on arcane magic, others have embraced change for the betterment of Quel'Thalas. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:472px'></div>

### Crimson
As a culture, the sin'dorei have retained the look and feel of their fallen high elven kingdom, though have developed a greater penchant for the colour of crimson: the colour of their namesake. Crimson-red robes, decor and armour have become far more commonplace within blood elven society prior to the fall of the high elven people, a reference to the blood of their many brethren who had perished in the Third War. The iconic and traditional blood elven colours are red, gold, and to a lesser extent, blue – all of which can be seen on their racial crest, the Icon of Blood.

### Proud Society
In general, the blood elves are a proud, pragmatic, and somewhat jingoistic people; they place great emphasis on their love for their homeland, and are ruthless to their enemies. Their reputation for isolationism is well-earned, and they prefer to keep to their own kind, although excep-tions to this stereotype exist. Blood elves are a resilient race of survivors, and their most prominent figures stand as beacons of courage, tenacity, and the strength to fight on, regardless of what foes stand in their way.

### Beautiful and Graceful
Blood elves are, biologically and physiologically high elves. With the largest difference being their emerald glowing eyes compared to the high elves blue.

They are slenderly built, standing at 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet, and averaging at 150 pounds. They have long pointy ears, high cheekbones, and are generally considered highly attractive by the standards of most mortal races. Both males and females commonly have long hair in light colorations, and males ability to grow facial hair is limited, resulting in very few having beards beyond an inch, and large facial hairs being completely absent.

### Affiliation
The Sin'dorei have joined the Horde. After the third war, the atrocities dealt to their kin by the xenophobic humans lead them to distrust the Alliance. Convinced by the former ranger General Sylvanas Windrunner, and with her speak-ing on their behalf to the leaders of the Horde.

Even though high elves and blood elves are physically the same, the elves do not get along well. What remains of the high elves see their other kin as traitors, and tainted. And blood elves are split between wishing to reunite their empire, and seeing their high elven kin as dishonored for their actions against them.

Blood elves for the most part use high elven names, as they originate from their high elven predecessors, many have either kept their past name, and given high elven names to their children. Unlike high elves, blood elven surnames are generally more aggressive, blood elves don't keep family names, with the exception of nobels wanting to carry on a certain name.

## Goblin
*I never cover up the things I'm proud of. If the world was gonna split in half tomorrow, I’d buy the Dark Portal, slap a toll booth on it, and charge refugees the last of their pocket change, the rings off their fingers, a bite of their meal, and a contractual obligation to build me a rocket palace in the skies of Nagrand. It’s the goblin way! Supply and demand! Deal with it!*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Trade Prince Jastor Gallywix* &nbsp;</div>

### Introduction
Slaves of the jungle trolls on their home isle, forced to mine kaja'mite ore out of the volcanic bowels of Mount Kajaro. The ore had an unexpected effect on the goblins, granting them cunning intelligence. They began to rebel in secret, engineering artifacts, and brewing alchemical substances to successfully overthrow their oppressors and claim Kezan their homeland.

Their prior prison become an expanding empire in the mines they had dugged. To their dismay, the effects of the kaja'mite ore wore off, and their increased intelligence waned, as the ore itself became scarce and dwindled. Their brilliant engineering dwindled in ingenuity, looking haphazardly put together. Their remaining craftiness and greed soon took its place, lifting the race to preeminence as masters of mercantilism. Great fortunes were amassed, and the isle became a hub for goblin traders.

### Technology
Goblins love of mechanics often places them into direct competition with gnomes who enjoy similar devices. The competition between goblins and gnomes seems to be friendly. Whether clockwork shredders that allow a single goblin to do as much harvesting as 10 field hands or zeppelin-like airships that can ferry troops over otherwise impassable terrain, the goblins' inventions have become legendary. Such technological ingenuity is as central to the goblins' rise among the races as any trading prowess.

Even with the malfunctions and explosions that occur, goblin technology is proving to be of a quality that rivals the dwarves and their firearms.

<div style='margin-top:490px'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While other races often try to build reliable machines that would stay for grandchildren, goblin aims for device of the marginally bearable reliability that should only last enough to make its construction reasonable. Weird as it is, this approach allows to build more machines, or to build a more complex and powerful machine using the same time and resources.

### Born Traders
Goblins have taken to the role of merchants, and it's hard to travel for more than a week or two without stumbling across a goblin shop of some size. Goblin shops can be found nearly anywhere on Azeroth, seemingly regardless of whether or not there are towns nearby and heedless of dangers such as the Scourge. The goblins will sell anything to anyone, at only slightly inflated prices.

Though many shops remain independent, a growing number of them have signs declaring that they are owned and operated by the Venture Company, which the proprietors claim is headquartered in a faraway city ruled by goblins where the streets are paved with gold.

The goblins are also legendary for the sheer variety of trade in which they are willing to indulge and for their tenacity in bargaining. 

### Small But Standing Tall
Goblins are slight and wiry, averaging 3 feet in height and weighing between 30 and 50 pounds. They have long, sharp noses, chins and ears, and green skin. Their arms are long and slender and their fingers deft. 

Female goblins are on average taller than most male goblins, even though the difference is miniscule, and close to nothing compared to other races.

### Affiliation
Goblins have found a recent enemy in the Alliance. Unpro-fitable encounters with the secretive SI:7 forces have driven them away from comfortable neutrality with both sides. Forcing them to reforge old pacts with their business partners and now allies the horde.

Although the Alliance is not fond of goblins, they still for the most part do trade with them when stumbled upon outside Stormwinds borders. Only member of the Alliance they tend to stay from are night elves, who carry a deep dislike towards the goblins because of their disrespect for the nature they continuously harvest for resources.

### Names 
Every goblin has a given name and a family name. The family names portray some ancestor’s achievement, though a goblin may take a new family name if he feels he has made an accomplishment that outstrips that of his forebear.

## Nightborne
*It had to be done this way, there was no other alternative. We no longer need the Nightwell, nor do we need its power. <br> We must forge our own destiny from now on.*

<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— First Arcanist Thalyssra* &nbsp;</div>

An impenetrable barrier was placed around their capital city Suramar, shielding the highborne from the Sundering. This shield would keep the highborne isolated from the rest of Azeroth's new continents for thousands of years. Forcing the highbornes to rely on their Nightwell for their magical powers. The highbornes evolved over the ages, and they called themselves the shal'dorei or nightborne.

When Suramar run out of food, the shal'dorei began to utilize the substance of their Nightwell as nourishment and was thus spared an untimely death, however, this soon caused them to be unable to survive without drawing magic from the Nightwell. Crime was punished by exile. Cutting them off from the Nightwell, the exiled would diminish into husks of their former selves, and eventually irreversible into mindless withered, waiting for death.

Ten thousand years later the nightborne lowered their shield and surrender to the Burning Legion by orders from their leader, Grand Magistrix Elisande. Many nightborne did not agree with her decision, but none dared speak against her newfound forces of demons. Through the aid of a nightborne resistance, and the forces of the Alliance and Horde. The Grand Magistrix and her demon allies were pushed back into the Twisting Nether.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:530px;'></div>

### Born in the Darkness
Sealed off within their capital of Suramar, the <br>nightborne physique in many ways resemble that <br>of their night elven kin, with tall slender bodies and <br>muscular builds. The ever darkened sky of their city <br>have changed their skin to be a dark blue or purple, <br>rather than the more vibrant colors of the night elves.<br> The Shal'dorei still practice arcane magic, giving their <br>eyes a dim blue or purple glow, instead of the golden glow of the night elves.

The nightborne are fiercely proud of the arcane ways, and proudly shows off shimmering tattoos of arcane energy that has been placed upon their body. The tattoos have no known impact on the nightborne capabilities, yet it stands as a show of a nightbornes comprehension of the arcane.

### Highborne Civilization
The Shal'dorei have an air of superiority that often comes across as pompous. They revel in their unequalled magical civilization but having no exposure to the current races of Azeroth until the rebellion led an invading force to free Suramar, many still regard outside races and the world as it was back then, full of the unworthy, the uncultured, and low born far beneath the standards and levels of the nightborne civilization.

These were the less admirable qualities of night elven civilization back then, and the shal'dorei continue in them as if nothing has changed and as if they still remain the center of the world.

### Affiliation
The Shal'dorei have been severed from the world for thousands of years, originally hailing from the night elven Highborne, many Nightbornes wished to return to their ancient kin. The night elves saw the careless use of arcane in the shal'dorei, knowing what it did to their civilization so many years ago and shunned them from their society.

A few amongst the Nightborne have sympathized with the blood elves and their past craving for their Sunwell and joined the Horde in their honor.

### Nightborne Names
Nightborne names resemble that of night elves, and would appear Darnassian in script to an inexperienced eye. Yet the nightbornes language have changed from their ancient tongue, as has their names. The nightbornes still follow the Kaldorei naming traditions.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 1, and your Intelligence score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Although nightborne elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, their understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. Nightborne typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to become several thousand years old. Sustained by the Night-well, many have lived since the War of the Ancient.

***Alignment.*** Order and structure are key to nightborne. Their society believes that reputation and status are of the utmost concern, and that mortality and principles of right and wrong are viewed too often in that light. Giving most nightborne a lawful alignment.

***Size.*** Nightborne are around 7 feet tall and weigh between 180 and 240 pounds. Your size is medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

# Independent Class Suggestions
</div>

The following are a set of class suggestions, pulled from World of Wacraft, as the classes the independent races will more than likely be. It is suggested that you pick from among your race's suggested classes to keep with the thematic elements of the setting. That said, heroes are meant to break molds and be the exception to rules, so feel free to pick a class that is not typically used by your race. If you do pick outside your racial classes though, work with your Dungeon Master to create a backstory for why you are a member of this class.

## Pandaren
*To ask why we fight... is to ask why the leaves fall. It is in their nature. Perhaps, there is a better question. <br>Why do we fight? To protect home, and family... To preserve balance, and bring harmony. <br> For my kind, the true question is, what is worth fighting for?*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Chen Stormstout* &nbsp;</div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

The pandaren have long been a mystery to other races of Azeroth, their history stretching back thousands of years, to before the raise of the kaldorei. Denizens of a wondrous and fertile land, the pandaren were slaves to the ancient titan-forged mogu. Through tenacity, diplomacy, and a unique form of unarmed combat, they staged a successful revolution that deposed the mogu, and established the foundation of the pandaren empire that would prosper for thousands of years.

As the sundering took place, Pandaria was shrouded in a magical mist that would last for thousand of years. As the years came to an end, the mist around Pandaria unveiled. Drawing the attention of both factions, wishing to claim this 'unexplored' land, and learn of what lied on its surface.

### Harmony in All Things
Pandarens are slow to anger, they prefer a measured solution to problems. It takes a great deal to wound up a pandaren. On their homeland Pandaria, negative emotions are harnessed, and take physical form to wreak havoc on the isle. Pandarens emphasize and cultivate a quiet life of inner harmony and focus. Conflicts, no matter how bitter, are quickly forgotten over cold drinks once the matter is resolved.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:540px'></div>

### A Spiritual Race
Pandaren have a fierce and deep belief in the connection of the material and spiritual world. In many ways their faith mirrors the ancient beliefs of night elves, and beliefs of the tribal races of Kalimdor.

Like the races of Kalimdor, the pandaren follow a shamanistic faith, they worship the Earth Mother and give passage to their dead. They are a society that reacts, rather than being the ones to act first. Many pandarens claim to be the water that flows around a rock -- it never pushes the rocks out of its way, but merely goes around it. This stands as the core of their society, a simple means of everyday life. If they set their mind to a task and fail, then they believe they went about it the wrong way, and try again.

### Covered in Fur
Covered in colorful fur from head to toe, pandaren appear like massive humanoid bears towering above the heads of most of Azeroth's inhabitants. They stand far over the head of humans, ranging from just under 7 feet to a few inches short of 8 feet. Pandarens are naturally curvy, only made larger in size by their thick fur, weighing between 310 to 440 pounds. Males stand slightly taller than females, and males are often much heavier than females.

Pandaren colorations varies widely, from a dark brown to a golden yellow, one thing that is consistent throughout all pandarens are their white markings, all pandarens have these upon their face, and many also have patches of white on their paws of torso. Pandarens don't have hair, but many stylize their fur on top of their head, letting it grow longer to resemble hair.

### Affiliation
Most pandaren are independent, preferring to avoid the con-flict of Alliance and Horde, but few amongst them have decided to join the ranks of either factions, believing that their philosophy aligns with that of the faction.

The Tushui pandaren have joined the alliance, believing that one should live a life through meditation, rigorous training, and moral convictions. The Huojin pandaren have joined the horde. believing that inaction is the greatest injustice, and that there is no shame in defending one's home and loved ones, regardless of the cost.

Pandaria have been hidden from the world for many thousand years, the inhabitants of Azeroth are new to the pandarens. Because of this they have no hatred or distrust for any of the new races they've met.

### Names
Pandaren naming practices are similar to those of humans, each pandaren are given a name at birth, and carries on the family name of their parents. Some pandaren are known to take a new family name reflecting their own achievements in life, yet such practices are uncommon.

You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write, Common and Mogu. Mogu is the language of Pandaria, forced upon the inhabitants of Pandaria by the mogu empire. It is a strange and unfamiliar language to the rest of Azeroth, with a multitude of words meaning one common thing.

# Chapter 2: Classes
Heroes are extraordinary people, driven by a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They arc heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of Azeroth and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can't stand against.

Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It's more than a profession; it's your character's calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the multiverse. A warrior, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A priest, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant in a god's unfolding plan or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the warrior has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the priest might know a number of healers, paladins, and devotees who share his faith.

Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a warrior's mastery of weapons and armor, and a mage's spells. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing features often improve. 

Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and a detailed explanation of each one.

Heroes sometimes advance in more than one class. A rogue might switch direction in life and swear the oath of a paladin. A barbaric warrior might discover latent magical ability and dabble in the arcanic classes while continuing to advance as a warrior. Elves are known to combine martial mastery with magical training and advance as warriors and mages simultaneously.

Optional rules for combining classes in this way, called multiclassing, appear in chapter 5.

Ten classes — listed in the Classes table — define the average spectrum of heroes on Azeroth, these are made as standable classes, but are intended to be playable alongside classes from the Player's Handbook.

## Druid
*Standing in the way of nature is heresy. Even when nature's force is a destructive one.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Malfurion Stormrage* &nbsp;</div>

Clutching an engraved staff stitched with leaves, a night elf summons the powers of elune, calling down raw blue energy of the moon upon a terrible foe, smashing upon its body and encasing it hole for a brief moment.

Crouching out of sight  on a low hanging tree branch, in the form of a large feral tiger, a worgen scouts out from his hiding stop towards the constructions of Zul'Gurub. Watching every move of the jungle trolls patrolling.

Holding near her sickle and staff, a young tauren druid is making beautiful ritual, making tiny seeds sprinkle into a perfect circle of faintly glowing green lights, healing an endured ally to the best of her capabilities.

Rushing forward towards his companions aid, rumbling the ground as his body transforms into a giant bear creature with tusks, an experienced troll runs to his allies aid, blocking a fatal blow with its fur.

### Nature's Power
Druids harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. With experience, druids can unleash nature’s raw energy against their enemies, raining celestial fury on them from a great distance, binding them with enchanted vines, or ensnaring them in unrelenting cyclones. Druids can also direct this power to heal wounds and restore life to fallen allies. 

They are deeply in tune with the animal spirits of Azeroth. As master shapeshifters, druids can take on the forms of a variety of beasts, morphing into a bear, cat, creatures of water, and creatures of air with ease. This flexibility allows them to fill different roles during their adventures, tearing enemies to shreds one minute and surveying the battlefield from the sky the next. These keepers of the natural order are among the most versatile heroes in Azeroth, and they must be prepared to adjust to new challenges on a moment’s notice.

### Protectors of Balance
Guardians of nature who seek to preserve balance and protect life, Druids have unmatched versatility on the field of battle. This is in part because druidism is much more than a fighting discipline.

It’s a way of life steeped in traditions so ancient that even the origin of their kind is preserved largely in mythology passed on through millennia.

Druids harness nature’s raw energy for an incredible breadth of offensive and defensive abilities, as well as to restore life to the wounded. Through communion with nature and the demigod Cenarius, Lord of the Forest, Druids are supernaturally endowed with the gift of shapeshifting, allowing them to take the form of all manner of nature’s creature and access powers as distinct as they are diverse.

### Creating a Druid
As you are creating your druid character, consider the bond you have with the natural world around you. Perhaps you always found comfort in the beasts of the wilds and have spent long in the shape of an animal, imitating nature itself? Perhaps your home was ravaged by raiders and you looked to the forces of nature for aid in rebuilding what was lost, seeking to restore that which has been damaged? or perhaps you have been raised by the faithful of Elune and have embraced the goddess as your own. Maybe your character was born in the depths of the elven forests, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.

Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove? Or perhaps you become an adventurer to find your bond to nature elsewhere in the world.


#### Quick Build
You can make a druid quickly be following these sugges&shy;tions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. (Some druids who focus more on their physical strength than mental makes Strength or Dexterity higher than Wisdom). Second, choose the hermit background.

\columnbreak

## Class Features
As a druid, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per druid level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** Light armor
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons
- **Tools:** Herbalism kit
___
- **Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom

- *(a)* a quarterstaff or *(b)* any simple weapon
- *(a)* a dagger or *(b)* any simple weapon
- Leather armor, explorer's pack, and a druidic focus

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Druidic
You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak, read and write Druidic, a language sacred to druids that is not taught to outsides without severe consequences for the teacher and teached.

### Spellcasting
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 of the *Player's Handbook* for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the druid spell list.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast a druid spell, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. 

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attune-ment to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack with one.

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br> your Wisdom modifier
</div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

### Shapeshifting
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume a druidic shape. There is no limitation to how often you can shapeshift into a shape that you know.

\columnbreak

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your druid level determines the shapes you can transform into, as shown in the Shapeshifts table. At 2nd level, for example, you can shapeshift into a cat or bear, among other shapeshifts.

##### Shapeshifts
|&nbsp; Level |&nbsp;&nbsp;| Available Shapeshifts |
|:-----------:|:-|:--------------------------------|
|&nbsp; 2nd   || Cat, Bear, Moonkin, Treant        |
|&nbsp; 4th   || Aquatic, Travel                   |
|&nbsp; 8th   || Flight                            |

There is no limit to how long you can stay shapeshifted, reverting to your normal form as a bonus action. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

- Your retain your game statistics, alignment, and person-ality. While shapeshifted you are considered unarmored and calculate your Armor Class according to the shape.
- When you shapeshift your hit points does not change, and any damage taken whilst in a shape carries over to your normal form.
- You can't cast spells, unless the shape says otherwise, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabil&shy;ities of your shapeshift. However, transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *moonbeam*, that you've already cast.
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the shapeshift is physically capable of doing so, in addition to gaining those of the shape. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new shape also has that sense.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment merged with your form has no effect and cannot be activated until you leave the form, but any passive magical properties will still affect you.

### Druid Paths
At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a druidic path: Balance, Feral, or Restoration, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Wild Affinities
Having accustomed yourself with the druidic forces, you have learnt how to harness the true potential of its powers and the potential of certain shapes.

At 3rd level, you gain two wild affinities of your choice. Your affinity options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain druid levels, you gain additional affinities of your choice, as shown in the Affinities Known column of the Druid table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the affinities you know and replace it with another affinities that you could learn at that level.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

> ##### Druidic Forms
> Shapeshifts are an extension of the druid. Both as a person but also as a race, a taurens shapeshifts might have horns similar to their own, an orc or troll might grant theirs tusks, a night elf might decorate theirs with signs of Elune, and so on. Similarly their beasts might be different, a night elf might choose a slim panther while a tauren chooses a stout lion.
>
> Certain shapes does not have to be grand transfor&shy;mations, a druid who shapeshifts into a moonkin might not become a giant owlbeast but instead take on qualities of Elune, make their eyes flare bright with silver and cover their skin in the dots of a starry night. A druid who takes the shape of a treant might instead take on qualities of the wilds. Turn their skin to bark, their hair to leaves, and so on.
>
> The shapeshifts are yours to personalize, although each is tied to certain type of animal or creature, you can modify its appearance to better fit your race, or talk with your DM about making it something completely different.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Timeless Body
Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield has caused you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

### Soul of the Forest
Beginning at 18th level, your connection with nature grows to new lengths, deepening your bond with nature and mak&shy;ing you able to conjure a gateway into the Emerald Dream.

Spending 10 minutes in an area of unspoiled nature, you can conjure a gateway to the Emerald Dream, the entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when conjuring the gateway can enter into the Emerald Dream for as long as the gate-way remains open. You can open and close the gateway if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the gateway on Azeroth crumbles and is effectively invisible. The gateway remains conjured for 24 hours, at which point it crumbles entire and cannot be conjured again for 7 days.

Additionally, beasts and plants of the wilds can sense your connection to nature, giving you advantage on all skill and ability checks made to communicate with them.

## <span style="margin-left:25px"></span> Druid Paths
<span style="margin-left:25px"></span> Although all druids have a deep love for nature and 
<span style="margin-left:30px"></span> wilderness, some carry a deep love for the beasts of 
<span style="margin-left:35px"></span> the world and imitate their shapes. Some have a 
<span style="margin-left:40px"></span> deep love for the goddess Elune and others wish to 
<span style="margin-left:45px"></span> preserving life. All druids can be placed into one of 
<span style="margin-left:50px"></span> paths: Balance, Feral, or Restoration druids.

\columnbreak

### Path of Balance
Druids on the Path of Balance become fierce combatants capable of calling upon the forces of nature and the beloved goddess Elune to guide their hand. Many of these druids grows a deep connection with the natural world and works to protect it from the many outside threats.


##### Path of Balance Spells
|&nbsp; Druid Level |&nbsp;&nbsp;| Spells           |
|:---------:|:-|:-----------------------------------|
|&nbsp; 3rd || enhance ability, moonbeam            |
|&nbsp; 5th || daylight, starsurge                  |
|&nbsp; 7th || confusion, grasping vine             |
|&nbsp; 9th || commune with nature, wrath of nature |
<div style='margin-top:-7px;'></div>

#### Path Spells
Your mystical connection to Elune infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to path spells.

Once you gain access to a path spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

#### Innervate
Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with the nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can re-cover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

#### Force of Nature
Beginning at 6th level, you can tap into the forces around you and use them to bolster your spellwork.

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature, you can choose to deal extra damage to it equal to your druid level, or restore hit points to it equal to your druid level. You can choose to use this feature before or after an attack roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Astral Influence,
Upon reaching 10th level, you find solace and empower&shy;ment in the goddess Elune, you gain the following features.

- You gain resistance to radiant damage.
- You can choose to deal radiant damage with your Force of Nature feature, rather than the spell's damage type.
- You have advantage on checks and saving throws to avoid being charmed or frightened by spell effects.
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

#### Blessing of the Ancients
Starting at 14th level, you balance between the two forces of the world. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can choose either *an'she* or *elune* and gain the benefits of the chosen balance until you finish your next rest.

***An'she.*** You are always under the effects of a *see invisi&shy;bility* spell. Additionally, you are immune to being blinded and can use a reaction to give a melee attack against you disadvantage as you invoke the forces of An'she.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Elune.*** You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet. Additionally, while you are in dim light or darkness, you can use your reaction to gain advantage on your spell attacks made until the end of your turn.

#### Incarnation: Chosen of Elune
At 20th level, you have been chosen by Elune and can let her powers flow through you, taking on an appearance as you choose. For examples, the colors and stars of elune might move across your skin, your moonkin shape might shine with a dim blue glow, or you might have a crescent moon floating above your head

You can use your action to assume your moonkin shape and let the powers of the goddess flow through you. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits.

- You can use a spell slot to cast the *moonbeam* spell, even if you don't have it prepared, and you can move the beam as a bonus action.
- The range of any druid spell you cast is doubled, and any druid spell with a range of touch has a range of 30 feet.
- You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, as do your allies within 30 feet of you.

The incarnation persists beyond the shapeshift, but has no effect outside of your moonkin shape. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Hunter
*The way of the hunter is one of mastery over the beasts of the world, an unparalleled precision in marksmanship, and the knowledge of how to survive in situations where others would perish.*

<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Ranger Sallina* &nbsp;</div>

Wild and barbaric looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a spear in his hands, he charges in with intense fury, a large bear running at his side, roaring as he engages, cutting down one enemy after another.

Tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, a night elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the blue dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.

Holding his hand high, a blood elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Thalassian, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.

### Inescapable Stalkers
From an early age the call of the wild draws some adventurers from the comfort of their homes into the unforgiving primal world outside. Those who endure become hunters. As masters of their environment, hunters are able to slip like ghosts through the trees and lay traps in the paths of their enemies. These expert marksman drop foes dead in their tracks with flawless shots from a bow, crossbow or rifle. With the ability to wield two weapons simultaneously, hunters can unleash a flurry of blows against anyone unfortunate enough to stumble into close combat with them.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:485px;'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The art of survival is central to the isolated life of a hunter. Hunters track beasts with ease and enhance their own abilities by attuning themselves to the feral aspects of various creatures. Hunters are known for the lifelong bonds they form with animals of the wild, training great hawks, cats, bears, and many other beasts to fight alongside them.

### Proud Rangers
The hunter is a stalker in the wilds, living on his knowledge of survival and skill with a bow or rifle. He is deeply in tune with nature, and some of its mightiest beasts are his allies. 

Of Azeroth's many creatures, few can resist the hunter's call, and fewer can survive his fury. Hunters are as varied as the world's many climates, but they are universally renowned for their amazing abilities to find their prey and bring it down. Most hunters seek to aid the balance of nature along with their druidic allies. Elven rangers are not alone in their mastery of the wilderness. While an elven ranger prefers the bow, the hunter would rather get up close. A hunter is skilled in stealth, slipping through the woods like a ghost. 

### The Hunter's Choice
Hunter is the choice of life for those who reject societies that oppress the natural role of prey and predator, and also reject the druidic stance that we should observe rather than actively participants in the "Great Hunt". 

They follow a life of reverence for nature complimenting their tradition and willingness to use man-made tools. We are all tool-using creatures after all, and it is only natural to use that advantage afforded by nature to be better hunters. There are however also those hunters who prefer a more direct approach to tracking and hunting.

### Creating a Hunter
As you create your hunter character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the hunter's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship. or was your mentor slain, perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of hunters affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.

Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?

When you make a check that allows you to apply your proficiency in Nature, Perception, or Survival, you can expend one focus die to bolster the check. Add half the number rolled on the focus die (rounded up) to your check. You apply this bonus after making the check, but before learning if it was successful.

#### Precision Attack
When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend a focus die to add it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before any of the effects of the attack are applied.

#### Survival Tactics
If you are hit by an attack while wearing light or medium armor, you can expend one focus die as a reaction and add the number rolled to your AC. If the attack still hits, you take half damage from it.

### Animal Empathy
Also at 2nd level, your mastery of hunter lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and the land around you.

You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it not to attack.

You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 24 hours.

### Hunter Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose to stake your path by the ideals of a hunter archetype: Beast Master, Marksmanship or Survival, each detailed at the end of the class description. 

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 5th, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

### Tame Beast
Beginning at 3rd level, you show a strengthened connection to the wilds and are able to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world.

You may attempt to tame a beast within 60 feet of you that can see and hear you, the beast can be no larger than Medium with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower. Taming a beast requires the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food and is a process that often takes many hours of work, or days (DM's discretion).

Once you tame a beast, it gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can only have one beast tamed at your side at a time.

#### Companion's Bond
Your loyal companion gains a variety of benefits.

- The beast loses its Multiattack action, if it has one. 
- Your companion obeys your commands as best it can. <br> It shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn imme&shy;diately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you use your bonus action to command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action. If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast acts on its own.
- Your beast companion has abilities and statistics determined in part by your level. Using your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, your companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.
- Your beast gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient in all saving throws.
- For each character level you gain after 3rd, your beast companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.
- Whenever you gain an *Ability Score Improvement* class feature, your companion's abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
- Your companions alignment changes to sharing yours.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Fleet of Foot
Starting at 8th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.

In addition, you are able to pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them or taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or similar hazards.

### Predator's Knowledge
At 10th level, you can glean intimate knowledge about the capabilities of your marked target. You can use your action to learn two of the following characteristics of your choice about the target of your hunter's mark if it's within 120 feet. 
 - Creature Type
 - Armor Class
 - Speed
 - Damage Vulnerabilities
 - Damage Resistances
 - Damage Immunities
 - Senses

Once you have gleaned the capabilities of a creature, you cannot use Predator’s Knowledge to learn more about the creature, or another creature like it, for the next 24 hours.

### Stalker
Beginning at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. In addition, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

\columnbreak

### Honed Senses
Starting at 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. 

You are also aware of the location of any invisible crea&shy;tures within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

### Aspect of the Wild
At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

## Hunter Archetypes
All hunters have certain things in common, such as their love for the wilderness, or their passion for beasts. But some hunters have more than love for beasts, and others a greater love for the wild, hunters fall into three categories: Beast Master, Marksman, and Survival.

### Beast Master
Among the gifted hunters, there are those who are drawn to the beasts of the wild and seek to bond with such crea&shy;tures. Beastmasters are often drawn towards the primal world, invigorated by its dangerous and untamed nature. The primitive world becomes their home and its ferocious predators becomes kin.

#### Dire Tamer
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you show a keen mind when dealing with beasts and are able to tame beasts that are Large or smaller with a challenge rating of 1 or lower.

#### Aspect of the Beast
Also at 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast the *beast sense* spell, but only as a ritual and only on your beast companion.

#### Kill Command
At 5th level, you and your beast companion form a more potent fighting team. You can use your bonus action and expend a focus die to issue a kill command to your beast companion. The beast takes the Attack action, making all attacks with advantage. You add the focus die to the damage roll of the first attack that hits.

#### Evasive Maneuver
Beginning at 7th level, when you or your beast <br> companion are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you can use your reaction to allow the both of you to avoid the brunt of the effect.

You take no damage if you succeed the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Your beast companion must be able to hear you and you must be able to see it in order for it to benefit from your Evasive Maneuver feature.

#### Bestial Wrath
Starting at 11th level, your companion can attack twice, instead of once -- or use its Multiattack, whenever you use your bonus action to command it to take the Attack action.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Kindred Spirit
At 15th level, your companion's call can keep you fighting and overcome grievous wounds. When you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points but not killed outright, your beast companion can use its reaction to call out to you. <br> If you can see or hear its call, you immediately regain hit points equal to your hunter level and remain conscious.

Once you (and your companion) uses this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Marksmanship
Marksmanship favor the use of weapons that are at their deadliest at great range. Many marksmanship hunters neglect the company of a beast, instead focusing solely on their own prowess. They shroud themselves from their target and deliver their shots to unaware quarries.

#### Arcane Shot
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can evoke arcane energy in your attacks. When you take the Attack action, you may choose to deliver your ranged weapon attacks against your marked creature as Arcane Shots. Until the end of your turn, your ranged attacks against your marked target gains the following benefits:

 - Your attacks ignores half and three-quarters cover.
 - On each hit, the weapon deals additional force damage to the target equal to 2 + half your hunter level.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. You regain all spent uses after finishing a short or long rest.

#### Lone Wolf: Aimed Attack
Also at 3rd level, you can choose to not tame a beast and instead focus on your own prowess. When you do not have the loyalty of a beast companion, you can use your bonus action to give your next weapon attack advantage. 

#### Concussive Shot
Starting at 5th level, when you hit a target with an attack that would cause it to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, you can expend a focus die and add it to the  difficulty class. You must do so before the target makes the save.

#### Lone Wolf: Extra Attack
Also at 5th level, when you do not have the loyalty of a beast companion you gain the Extra Attack feature, and can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the attack action on your turn.

#### Aspect of the Eagle
Beginning at 7th level, you can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you.

In addition, attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.

#### Multiattack
Upon reaching 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

***Chimaera Shot.*** Once on each of your turns, when you make a ranged weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon. If used with your Lone Wolf feature, both attacks have advantage.

\columnbreak

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Piercing Shot.*** Once on each of your turns, when you make a ranged weapon attack against a creature, you can make the attack pierce through multiple creatures. Make an attack roll with disadvantage against each creature in a line directly behind the original target, until you miss, hit an object, or reach the normal range of your weapon, which&shy;ever comes first.

The piercing attacks do not benefit from effects that give you advantage, or cancel disadvantage. However, if used with your Lone Wolf: Aimed Attack feature, the attacks are no longer made with disadvantage.

#### Marksman's Focus
At 15th level, when you roll for initiative and have no uses of arcane shot remaining, you regain one use.

### Survival
For some hunters, the calling of the wilds is all they care about. To live and breathe among its flora and fauna and become a reflection of its harsh environment. These keen hunters favor their wits and knowledge of the land over the raw strength of their companion or their aim at a distance.

#### Adapt Trapper
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to place and infuse traps with the vigor of nature.

***Traps Known.*** You learn two traps of your choice, which are detailed under "traps".

You learn an additional trap of your choice at 7th, 11th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new traps, you can also replace one trap you know with a different one.

***Placing a Trap.*** You can use your action and expend a use of this feature to place a trap in an empty space within 30 feet of you. A trap lasts for 1 hour, until it is activated, or until you retrieve it.

A creature approaching your trap must succeed on a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check against your trap save DC to notice it. A creature automati&shy;cally succeeds the check if it saw you place the trap.

You can place two traps between rests. You regain all expended trap uses when you finish a short or long rest. <br> At 11th level, you can place thre traps between rests.

***Activating a Trap.*** A trap has a range of 5 feet. When a creature other than you or your beast companion enters the trap's range or starts its turn there, the trap is activated and destroyed.

***Deactivating a Trap.*** You can retrieve a placed trap that has not been activated by using an action while within 5 feet of it, regaining one expended use of this feature.

***Saving Throws.*** Your traps require your target to make a saving throw to resist its effect. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Trap save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Wisdom modifier
</div>

#### Student of the Wilds
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in survival if you don't already have it and your proficiency bonus doubles for any ability check you make with it.

#### Lone Wolf: Born to be Wild
Also at 3rd level, you can choose to not tame a beast and instead focus on your own prowess. When you do not have the loyalty of a beast companion, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. You can also take the Disengage actions as a bonus action.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum



#### Wing Clip
Starting at 5th level, when you hit a target with a weapon attack, you can expend a focus die to attempt to hamper it. The target must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check (DC equals your Trap save DC + your focus die). On a failed saving throw, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.

#### Lone Wolf: Extra Attack
Also at 5th level, when you do not have the loyalty of a beast companion you gain the Extra Attack feature, and can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the attack action on your turn.

#### Natural Camouflage
Beginning at 7th level, you gain the ability to cast the *pass without trace* spell without providing material components, but only as a ritual. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, or other natural occurring materials for you to be able to do so.

#### Marked Counter
Upon reaching 11th level, if your marked target forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make a weapon attack against the quarry. You make this attack before making the saving throw. If your attack hits, you gain advantage on your saving throw, in addition to the attack's normal effects.

#### Terms of Engagement
At 15th level, you show unparalleled control over your traps and utilize the openings they create.

You gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on weapon attacks against any creature who was hit by one of your traps since the end of your last turn.
- Your traps no longer activates when a creature moves within range, instead you can choose as a free action to activate a trap, even if there is no creature nearby.

\columnbreak

#### Traps
The traps are presented in alphabetical order.

***Bear Trap.*** When the trap is activated, each creature within range must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone in their space. Any creature knocked prone by this trap has their movement speed reduced to 0 until the start of their next turn.

***Blinding Trap.*** When the trap is activated, each creature within range must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target is blinded until the start of its next turn.

Any invisible creature who fails this saving throw glitter with dim light, making them visible for the duration.

***Ensnaring Trap.*** When the trap is activated, each creature within range must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. A creature restrained by this trap can use its action to make a Strength check against your Trap save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

***Explosive Trap.*** When the trap is activated, each creature within range must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage equal to twice your hunter level on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

***Freezing Trap.*** When the trap is activated, the creature who activated it must make a Dexterity saving throw, or be restrained for 1 minute. While a creature restrained by this trap the creature has total cover and can't take any actions other than attempt to break free by making a Strength check against your Trap save DC. On a success, it breaks the ice and frees itself. This trap has no effect on Huge or larger creatures.

The creature is encased in ice, the ice has an AC of 10 and hit points equal to four times your hunter level.

***Ice Trap.*** When the trap is activated, ice expands from the trap in a 20-feet-radius around it and making the area difficult terrain. A creature that starts its turn, or moves across the area for the first time on its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

***Immolation Trap.*** When the trap is activated, each creature within range must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage equal to your hunter level on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. On a failed save, the creature takes damage equal to half your hunter level (rounded up) at the start of each of its turns until the flames are doused as an action.

***Venom Trap.*** When the trap is activated, each creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the poisoned condition fades.

## Mage
*Always remember that power is a double-edged blade. One side light, the other dark. It calls to you, where you are most desperate; when victory seems worth any sacrifice. There is a price to be paid for such a gift, and many eagerly accept the bargain. Power alone is not to be feared. <br>Fear, instead, those who wield it.*
<div style="text-align:Right">

*— Jaina Proudmoore* &nbsp;</div>

Clad in a golden robe, a blood elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefields and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into an engulfing conflagration.

The air shimmers, as a draenei lifts his hands above his head twisting the air around him into a barrier of force engulfs him, blocking a barrage of attacks against him.

Golden eyes flashing, a human stomps his foot into the ground as a crippling fire sets him ablaze, as swords clash against him, an inferno of fire spews out at the attackers, engulfing them in hellfire.

Mages are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the leylines of magic that permeates Azeroth, mages cast spells of explo-sive fire, arcing lightning, and subtle deception. Their magic can conjure monsters from other planes of exis-tence, or glimpses the future. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals across continents.

\columnbreak
<div style='margin-top:520px'></div>

### Masters of Time and Space
Students gifted with a keen intellect and unwavering discipline may walk the path of the mage. The arcane magic available to magi is both great and dangerous, and thus is revealed only to the most devoted practitioners. To avoid interference with their spellcasting, mages wear only cloth armor, but arcane shields and enchantments give them additional protection. To keep enemies at bay, mages can summon bursts of fire to incinerate distant targets and cause entire areas to erupt, setting groups of foes ablaze. Masters of ice can command blizzards that tear into flesh and limit movement. Should enemies manage to survive this assault, mages can shrink them into harmless sheep in the blink of an eye.

Powerful magi can even generate enhancements and portals, assisting allies by sharpening their minds and transporting them instantly across the world.

### Scholars of the Arcane
Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the titans, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.

Mages live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other mages, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures that are steeped in magic.

### The Lure of Knowledge
Mages' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a mage is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous mages out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most mages believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

### Creating a Mage
Creating a mage character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?

What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other mages? Perhaps you're simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the face of danger.

#### Quick Build
You can make a mage quickly by following these sugges-tions. First, lntelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity.

## Class Features
As a mage, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per mage level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per mage level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** None
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons
- **Tools:** None
___
- **Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom
- **Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
 - *(a)* quarterstaff or *(b)* a dagger
 - *(a)* a component pouch or *(b)* an arcane focus

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

<br>

 - *(a)* a scholar's pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack
 - A spellbook

### Spellcasting
As a student of arcane, you own a spellbook with spells that show the glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 of Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the mage spell list.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the mage spell list. You learn additional mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Mage table.

<div style='margin-top:30px;'></div>

> ##### Your Spellbook
> The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell re-corded on a scroll in an evil sorcerer's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.
>
> ***Copying a Spell into the Book.*** When you find a mage spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
>
> Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the mage who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
>
> For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experi-ment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
>
> ***Replacing the Book.*** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book — for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spell&shy;book, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.
>
> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. The remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. Many mages keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
>
> ***The Book's Appearance.*** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorations and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you re-ceived as a gift, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

\columnbreak

#### Spellbook
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level mage spells of your choice. Your spellbook does not contain your known cantrips.
<div style='margin-top:-2px;'></div>

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Mage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of mage spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of mage spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your mage level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example. if you're a 3rd-level mage, you have four <br> 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of mage spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memori-zing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
<div style='margin-top:-2px;'></div>

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your mage spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll.

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br> your Intelligence modifier
</div>
<div style='margin-top:-2px;'></div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a mage spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.
<div style='margin-top:-2px;'></div>

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your mage spells.
<div style='margin-top:-2px;'></div>

#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
Each time you gain a mage level, you add two mage spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Mage table. On your adventurers, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the "Your Spellbook" sidebar).

### Arcane Recovery
You learn to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your mage level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be of 6th level or higher.

For example, if you're a 4th-level mage, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Magical Study
Starting at 2nd level, you choose a magical study, shaping your practice of magic through one of three areas: Arcane, Fire or Frost, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Metamagic
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. When you use your Metamagic, you choose which effect to twist your spell with. You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted and when you use a metamagic option, you can't use that option again until you finishg a long rest.

#### Accurate Spell
You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell that hits only one creature, to give yourself advantage on the spell attack roll.

#### Careful Spell
You can use your metamagic to protect creatures from your spells saving throw. Choose a number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw.

#### Empowered Spell
You can use your metamagic when you roll damage for a spell to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). You must then use the new damage rolls.

#### Extended Spell
You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

#### Distant Spell
You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater to double the range of the spell.

You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell that has a range of touch to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

#### Persistent Spell
You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell that targets only one creature and requires a saving throw, to give the creature disadvantage on the saving throw.

#### Quickened Spell
You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action to cast it as a bonus action.

#### Ricocheting Spell
You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell that targets only one creature and another creature is within 5 feet of it, to make the damage of your spell ricochet and hit both. The second target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save it takes half damage, and no damage on a successful save. It is not affected by any other effects of the spell.

#### Subtle Spell
You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

\columnbreak

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2. or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Spell Mastery
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level mage spell and a 2nd-level mage spell that are in your spell&shy;book. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

You can spend 8 hours in study, and change one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same level.

### Signature Spells
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over <br> two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. <br> Choose two 3rd-level mage spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

## Magical Studies
Mages are spellcasters who favor magics involving the cardinal elements of the universe. Students gifted with a keen intellect and unwavering discipline may walk the path of the mage. The magic available to mages is both great and dangerous, and thus is revealed only to the most devoted practitioners.

### Study of Arcane
Mages of the arcane are diviners of secrets, balancing the webb and flow of incredible mystic energies. These practi-tioners push their magical knowledge to its very limits. Those who master this craft are capable of releasing a barrage of unrelenting power upon their enemies.

#### Transmutation Savant
Beginning when you select this study at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.

#### Magic Resonance
Starting at 2nd level, whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot, you gain an arcane charge. You can accumulate a number of arcane charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Your arcane charges last until expended, or until the end of your next long rest.

You can use your action and expend all arcane charges to unleash a barrage of arcane magic. For each arcane charge expended, make a ranged spell attack against a target within 60 feet of you that you can see. On a hit, a target takes force damage equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Arcane Brilliance
Upon reaching 6th level, you gain proficiency in arcana <br> if you don't already have it and your proficiency bonus doubles for any ability check you make with it.

Additionally, you are always under the effects of a *comprehend languages* spell.

#### Prismatic Barrier
Starting at 10th level, you can siphon arcane energy <br> from harmful effects to your own benefit. You can use your reaction when you are forced to make a saving throw against magic to give yourself advantage on the save. On a failed save, you suffer the spells effect, but take only half damage (if any). On a success&shy;ful save, you take no damage from the spell and gain one arcane charge.

You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Rune of Power
At 14th level, you can draw upon your prowess and etch lines of arcane power into the ground. As an action, you etch an arcane rune into the ground in a 5-foot radius around you. The rune lasts for 1 minute. You gain the following benefits while you are within the its area:

 - You gain an arcane charge at the end of your turn, and can use Magic Resonance feature as a bonus action.
 - Once per turn when you cast a spell. You can choose to affect it with one of the metamagic options found earlier in this class without expending a metamagic use.
 - You have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on a mage spell.
 - You can cast the *haste* or *slow* spell even if you don't know them or have them prepared.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

\columnbreak

### Study of Fire
While any worthy mage is an unparalleled expert in the use of magic and heavily dedicated to their craft, those who master the forces of fire tend to be a little more audacious than their peers. These mages take pride, even pleasure in igniting their enemies in wild bursts of flame.

#### Evocation Savant
Beginning when you select this study at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.

#### Hot Streak
Starting at 2nd level, the blazing energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.

At 10th level, you may choose any number of dice that rolled the highest number possible, you can only reroll each dice once.

#### Cauterize
Beginning at 6th level, if you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to draw on the fiery energy that burn within you. You are instead reduced to 1 hit point, and each creature within 10 feet of you takes fire damage equal to half your mage level + your Intelligence modifier.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Empowered Evocation
Upon reaching at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage roll of any mage evocation spell that you cast. The damage bonus applies to one damage roll of a spell, not multiple rolls.

#### Combustion
At 14th level, you can unleash the flames that blaze within you. As an action, you wreathing yourself in swirling fire. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

 - You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
 - Any creature takes fire damage equal to half your mage level if it hits you with a melee attack.
 - Any spell or effect you create ignores resistance to fire damage and treats immunity to fire damage as resistance to fire damage.
 - Your spell attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Study of Frost
Frost mages stand apart from their colleagues, in that their chosen school of magic focuses on maintaining supreme control over the capabilities of their enemies. Mages who command frost perform chilling displays on the battlefield, rendering foes immobile as they bombard them with ice.

#### Conjuration Savant
Beginning when you select this study at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

\pagebreakNum

#### Fingers of Frost
Starting at 2nd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice:

***Ice Barrier.*** You can weave the cold around yourself for protection. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals cold damage to a creature, you can simultaneously warp part of the spell's magic to create an icy barrier on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The barrier has hit points equal to twice your mage level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the barrier takes the damage instead. If the damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

When the barrier is reduced to 0 hit point, each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have their speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn as the barrier bursts.

While the barrier has 0 hit points, it cant absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals cold damage, the barrier regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.

Once you create the barrier, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.

***Water Elemental.*** You learn how to conjure a water elemental. It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See the creature's game statistics in the water elemental stat block.

In combat, the water elemental shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or the Dash, Disengage, or Help action.

If you target the water elemental with a spell that deals cold damage, it is considered immune to the damage and regains a number of hit points equal to it. You don't need to roll to hit your elemental and it automatically fails any saving throw for it if you choose it.

At the end of a long rest, you can conjure a new water elemental. If you already have a water elemental from this feature, the first one immediately perishes.

#### Brain Freeze
Beginning at 6th level, whenever you deal cold damage to a creature with a mage spell, it must succeed on a Constitu&shy;tion saving throw or have its movement speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of your next turn as it becomes *chilled*.

When you deal cold damage to a *chilled* creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be grappled until the end of your next turn as it becomes *frozen*.

You have advantage on any spell attack you make against a *frozen* creature. If you successful hit a frozen creature the ice around it shatters and returns its speed to normal.

#### Hands of Frost
Upon reaching 10th level, you gain one of the following features, depending on your choice at 2nd level.

***Ice Barrier.*** When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Ice Barrier to manifest around it and absorb the damage. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the barricaded creature takes any remaining damage.

In addition, a creature who fails the saving throw when your ice barrier bursts becomes *chilled.*

## Monk
*To ask why we fight... is to ask why the leaves fall. It is in their nature. Perhaps, there is a better question.
Why do we fight? To protect Home, and Family... To preserve Balance, and bring Harmony.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Chen Stormstout* &nbsp;</div>

Taking a deep breath, an orc clad in loose clothes fastens his footings. As the first charging arcs reach him, he ex-hales a cone of fire from his mouth, engulfing his foes.

A gnome standing behind her allies as attacks clash down upon them. She focuses her chi, manifesting a statue of pure jade, as she sends a beam of chi towards her ally, soothing their wounds.

A tauren springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of gnolls on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.

Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

### The Flow of Chi
Monks make careful study of the magical energy they call chi. The pandaren word for 'spirit', they use the energy of their inner spirit, that flows through every living body. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabili-ties. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes, as they gain experi-ence, their training and their mastery of chi gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:654px'></div>

### Training and Asceticism
Small walled cloisters dot the world,  tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn't be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.

Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or other mortal or divine power.

The majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.

For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifes to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly.

### Creating a Monk
As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery's threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?

Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Arc you eager to return to your home? As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness chi, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.

#### Quick Build
You can make a monk quickly by following these sugges-tions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom.

\columnbreak

\pagebreakNum

### Unarmored Defense
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.

### Martial Arts
At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing mail or plate armor or wielding a shield:

 - You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and weapons.
 - You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
 - When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action.

### Chi
Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of chi. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of chi points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Chi Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various chi features. You start knowing four such features: Fists of Fury, Elusive Dance, Step of the Wind, and Effuse. You learn more chi features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a chi point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended chi back into yourself. You must spend 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your chi points.

Some of your chi features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Chi save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Wisdom modifier
</div>

#### Fists of Fury
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 chi point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

#### Elusive Dance
You can spend 1 chi point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

#### Step of the Wind
You can spend 1 chi point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

#### Effuse
You can spend 1 chi point and use your bonus action to touch a creature. The creature regains hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.

\columnbreak

### Roll
Starting at 2nd level, you can tumble across the battlefield when you are not wielding a shield. Once per turn, you can expend movement to roll a number of feet in a straight line equal to the movement expended. You can roll through the space of any hostile creatures, however, you cannot end your roll within their space.

Any opportunity attacks made against you while you're rolling are made with disadvantage.

### Monastic Tradition
When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Brewmaster, the Way of the Mistweaver, or the Way of the Windwalker, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th. 11th, and 17th level.

### Serenity
At 3rd level, you may enter a serene stance for 1 minute when you use chi points. While in this stance, you use your Wisdom modifier for your attack and damage rolls when attacking with a monk weapon or your unarmed strikes.

Your serenity ends early if you become charmed, fright&shy;ened, or incapacitated, or if you try to accomplish a task more strenuous than interacting with an object.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Stunning Palm
Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of chi in an opponent's body. Once per turn when you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 chi point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Chi-Empowered Strikes
Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Evasion
At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's frost breath or a *fireball* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and half damage if you fail.

### Detox
Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to remove one disease or poisoned condition that is affecting you.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Transcendence
Upon reaching 9th level, you can concentrate your chi into an incorporeal visage of yourself for you to traverse to in the future. You can use your action and spend 1 chi point to summon the visage in your space, the visage is incorporeal and can't be interacted with. The visage linger for 1 minute before disappearing.

While you are within 60 feet of it, you can use your bonus action to transcend the material world and teleporting to the visage's space. The incorporeal visage then disappears.

At 18th level, your incorporeal jade visage lingers for 1 hour, and the range at which you can transcend to it is increased to 1 mile.

### Inner Peace
Beginning at 10th level, you can use your bonus action and spend 1 chi point to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### Rushing Jade Wind
Starting at 13th level, immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 chi points and choose any number of creatures within 5 feet of you. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be pushed 10 feet directly away from you, a target pushed this way provokes opportunity attacks from nearby creatures.

### Diffuse Magic
At 14th level, your flow of chi fortifies you against harmful spells and effects. You have advantage on all intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.

### Timeless Body
Beginning at 15th level, your chi sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't he aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

### August Blessing
Beginning at 18th level, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 chi point to reroll it. You must use the new result.

### Perfect Zen
At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no chi points remaining, you regain 4 chi points.

## Monastic Traditions
There are many monastic traditions that have made their mark on Azeroth, some reminiscent of the martial artists from Pandaria and others much more unique. Three such traditions are honored among monks and taught. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.

\columnbreak

### Way of the Brewmaster
Brewmasters are often quirky and joyful, many would think them merely as fools that enjoy a drink to bring gladness to the despondent or to demonstrate humility to the arrogant, but when battle is joined, the brewmaster can be a madden-ing, masterful foe.

#### Bonus Proficiency
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in brewer's supplies. If you are already proficient in brewer's supplies, your proficiency bonus doubles for any ability check you make with it.

#### Elusive Brewer
At 3rd level, you learn to channel your chi into brews that bolster your powers.

You know the Black Ox brew and one other brew of your choice, all of which are detailed in the "Elusive Brews" section below. You learn one additional brew of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the brews you know and replace it with another brew that you could learn at that level

***Using Elusive Brews.*** Your elusive brews all require an action to be used, when you take the action you choose which known brew you wish to drink and spend chi points equal to its cost. A brew requires you to spend chi points each time you use it unless specified otherwise.

To use any of your known brews, you must have a flask of drinkable liquid on you as all brews require you to channel chi into some liquid as you drink it.

#### Stagger
Beginning at 6th level, you learn to shrug off harmful attacks made against you. You can use your reaction upon taking damage to give yourself resistance to all damage dealt by the attack, except psychic damage.

You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Light Brewing
Starting at 11th level, when you use your action to drink a brew, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.

At 17th level, this increases to two unarmed strikes.

#### Elusive Brews
The elusive brews are presented in alphabetical order. If a brew requires a level, you must be that level in this class to learn the brew.

***Black Ox Brew.*** You can spend 1 chi point to give your&shy;self advantage on the next melee attack you make. You may make one melee attack as part of the same action.

***Blackout Brew (11th level Required).*** You can spend 3 chi points to gain the effects of the *blur* spell for 1 minute.

***Breath of Fire (6th level Required).*** You can spend 2 chi points to exhale fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage equal to your Monk level + your Wisdom modifier on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

\pagebreakNum

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Fortifying Brew.*** You can spend 1 chi point to gain temporary hit points equal to half your Monk level + your Wisdom modifier.

***Invigorating Brew (11th level Required).*** You can spend 4 chi points to gain the effects of the *haste* spell for 1 minute.

***Purifying Brew. (17th level Required).*** You can spend 5 chi points to cast *greater restoration* on yourself.

***Thunder Tea.*** You can spend 1 chi point to gain the strength of Xuen, until the end of your next turn, your melee attacks deal extra thunder damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.

### Way of the Mistweaver
Mistweavers are unique among those who heal. They channel energies that are mysterious, oftentimes misunder&shy;stood by commoners as some form of folk medicine. <br> But those who weave the mists wield the power of life’s essence, using a mixture of preventative and restorative spells to mend their allies’ wounds.

#### Soothing Mist
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you have a pool of healing chi that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your monk level x 10.

As an action, you can manifest a beam of chi towards a creature within 30 feet of you and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Soothing Mist, expending hit pointss separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

#### Chi-Ji's Palm
At 3rd level, when you use your Soothing Mist feature, you can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action and may use your Wisdom modifier for the attack and damage roll with this attack.

#### Mistwalk
At 6th level, you are able to teleport short distances through mist. As an action, you can spend 1 chi point and teleport 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. As part of the same action you can use your soothing mist on a target within range of your new position.

#### Ring of Peace
Upon reaching 11th level, you can use your action and choose a number of creatures within 15 feet of you equal to your Wisdom modifier. A target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of your next turn or until it takes damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

\columnbreak

#### Statue of the Jade Serpent
At 17th level, you can give your chi physical form, shaping it into a statue of Yu'lon the Jade Serpent. You can spend 3 chi points as an action, and choose an empty space within 30 feet of you, manifesting a statue of jade. 
The statue has hit points equal to twice your monk level, resistance to all damage, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. Whenever you use your Soothing Mist feature, you may choose a second target within 60 feet of the jade statue to be healed for half of the hit points you restore.

The statue remains for 1 minute or until it is destroyed.

### Way of the Windwalker
Among monks, none have mastered the martial arts as the windwalkers have, and few across Azeroth can fight with their grace. Windwalkers possess unparalleled physical finesse, and are capable of overwhelming their enemies with a dizzying flurry of punches and kicks. 

#### Spear Hand Strikes
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy's chi when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Fists of Fury, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:

 - It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
 - It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
 - It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.

#### Tiger's Reflexes
Also at 3rd level, you react with the swiftness of a tiger. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative equal to your Wisdom modifier.

#### Windwalking
Beginning at 6th level, when you use Step of the Wind chi feature you gain a flying speed equal to half your movement speed until the end of your turn. If you end your turn in the air, you immediately fall to the ground.

In addition, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to twice your monk level.

#### Unpredictable Strikes
Upon reaching at 11th level, whenever you make an oppor-tunity attack, you may spend 1 chi point to use your Fists of Fury feature against the target instead.

#### Quivering Palm
At 17th level, you are able to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 chi points to start these impercep&shy;tible vibrations, which lats for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When done, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.

You can only have one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can chose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.

## Paladin
*Vengeance cannot be a part of what we must do. If we allow our passions to turn to bloodlust, then we will become as vile as the orcs.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Uther the Lightbringer* &nbsp;</div>

Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.

A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.

Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, a blood elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.

Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by the light to stand against the forces of evil. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.

<br>
<div style='margin-top:505px'></div>

### Paladins Call
This is the call of the paladin: to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish evil from the darkest corners of the world. 
These holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so they can confront the toughest of foes, and the blessing of the Light allows them to heal wounds and, in some cases, even restore life to the dead. Ready to serve, paladins can defend their allies with sword and shield, or they can wield massive two-handed weapons against their enemies. The Light grants paladins additional power against the undead and demons, ensuring that these profane beings corrupt the world no longer.

Paladins are not only zealots, but also guardians of the righteous, and they bestow blessings on those the Light would shine upon. The Light radiates from paladins, and worthy allies who stand near them are emboldened by its power.

### Beyond the Mundane Life
Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.

</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.

### Creating a Paladin
The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don't appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the light, justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Or are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow? 

How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from the light while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin's life was your calling.

As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice.

#### Quick Build
You can make a paladin quickly by following these sugges-tions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. (Paladins who strive to please the holy light and heal their allies make Constitution higher than Strength.)

## Class Features
As a paladin, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per paladin level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 + your Constitution modifier per paladin level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** All armor, shields
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
- **Tools:** None
___
- **Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma
- **Skills:** Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPPYV7h.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:0px; width:1200px' />

\pagebreakNum


#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
 - *(a)* a greatsword or *(b)* any martial weapon
 - *(a)* a priest's pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack
 - Chain mail, shield and a holy symbol

### Divine Sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the demon Illidan Stormrage, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

### Lay on Hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5,

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that crea-ture, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

### Spellcasting
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as
a priest does. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of
spelicasting and chapter 6 of this book for the paladin spell list.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convic-tions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br> your Charisma modifier
</div>

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.

### Crusader Strike
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. Crusader Strikes damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.

### Sacred Oath
When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of the Holy, the Oath of Protection, or the Oath of Retribution, all detailed at the end of the class description.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPPYV7h.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:0px; width:1200px' />

\pagebreakNum

<div style='margin-top:140px;'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

#### Oath Spells
Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the pala-din spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.

#### Channel Divinity
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.

### Divine Auras
Upon reaching 3rd level, you are able to emit your divinity onto creatures within 10 feet of you as divine auras. 

As an action you active a divine aura, choosing which effect to create, you can only have one aura active at a time. The aura persists for 1 hour before vanishing. You must then finish a long rest to use a Divine Aura again.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Divine Aura twice between rests, and you gain an additional use at 10th, 14th, and 17th level. When you finish a long rest, you regain your expended uses.

At 18th level, the range of your aura increases to 30 feet.

#### Aura of Courage
You and friendly creatures can't be charmed or frightened.

## Sacred Oath
Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.

### Oath of the Holy
Like priests who serve the Light, holy paladins are devout in their faith. Those who pledge themselves to the holy oath becomes beacons of the Light for their allies in conflict, taking up the heavy armor and weaponry of justice.

## Priest
*It is faith in ourselves that separates us from others, and with our powers, we will cause great change in all of Azeroth. The weak will come to lean on you. The lepers will call you Lord. And the ignorant will look to you for guidance.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Dark Cleric Duesten* &nbsp;</div>

Bend down over her falling ally, a dwarf clutches her holy symbol, and begins to sing a slow melodic tune, holy light shining from her hand, covering her allies limp body.

Kneeling on the ground, one hand firmly grasping a staff, the other filled with swirls of divine and necrotic energies. A human raises, and sends out a thick halo of light and dark energy out around him, his allies gaining new life, his enemies feeling the rush of necrotic through their bodies.

A forsaken, surrounded in voidic energy pulls his holy symbol from his neck as void covers his body. Tentacles sprouting from his back, as he sends out a laughter, spew-ing bolts of necrotic energy towards enemies and allies.

Priests are the bridge between light and dark, they are the wielders of the warmth holy light of the divine, and the voidic magic granted by the old gods. They serve as protectors, healers, and casters of insanity.w

### Invokers of Light and Darkness
Priests are devoted to the spiritual, and express their unwavering faith by serving the people. For millennia they have left behind the confines of their temples and the comfort of their shrines so they can support their allies in war-torn lands. In the midst of terrible conflict, no hero questions the value of the priestly orders. These masters of the healing arts keep their companions fighting far beyond their normal capacities with an array of restorative powers and blessings. The divine forces at the priest’s command can also be turned against foes.

As light cannot exist without darkness, and darkness without light, some priests tap into shadow to better understand their own abilities, as well as the abilities of those who threaten them.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:726px;'></div>

### Devoted Acolytes
Priests practice a complex, organized form of spirituality built around moral philosophy, the worship of a particular deity (such as Elune) in some cases, and/or idol worship, rather than around the reverence of the elements that shamans practice, or the close divine connection with animals and the wilderness that druids maintain. Priests serve not only as influential religious figures in their respective societies, but also as powerful practitioners of divine magic, which they use to heal and protect, or harm and weaken.

Devotion to the faiths of Azeroth leads many priests to the paths of courage and heroism. In dark times, priests carry the Light of faith with them as a reminder of the powerful forces at work beyond the comprehension of the peoples who walk the land. Powerful healers with an intimate connection to the divine, priests are empowered with abilities that aid them in times of dire need.

### Creating a Priest
Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the holy light?, a disciplined priest, in beautiful robes, monitoring a sept? or are you an unholy priest of shadows, fallen either by choice or forcefully towards the necrotic arts?

How did you enter priesthood? Were you raised in a mo-nastery? Did you hear a whisper from the light itself telling you to serve it? Or did a terrible war force you to take up the warmth of the holy light to assist your allies? Perhaps you might have known from your earliest memories that the priest's life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.

As guardians against forces of wickedness and evil, priests are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and soothing, or did you never feel the warmth of the holy light, and instead felt the calling of the old gods? their voidic magic wrapping around you, making your actions chaotic?

#### Quick Build
You can make a priest quickly by following these sugges&shy;tions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.

\columnbreak

### Spellcasting
As a conduit for divine power. you can cast priest spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the priest spell list.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the priest spell list. You learn additional priest cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Priest table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Priest table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of priest spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the priest spell list. When you do so choose a number of priest spells equal to your Charisma modifier + your priest level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level priest, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *flash heal*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of priest spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your priest spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a priest spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a priest spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br> your Charisma modifier
</div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a priest spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your priest spells.

Your choice might correspond to a particular branch of the divine callings, it could simply be a matter of personal preference, following the purpose that appeals to you the most.

### Discipline
Some priests pride themselves on pragmatism. They understand that light casts a shadow, that darkness is defined by light, and that true discipline stems from one’s ability to balance these opposing powers in services of a greater cause. While these priests possess many holy virtues to aid their allies, they also dabble in the dark arts to debilitate their enemies.

As a bonus action, you can grant a barrier to a friendly creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. The barrier is invisible.

#### Castigation
Starting at 14th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage, choose one creature damaged by that spell on the round you cast it. That creature takes extra radiant or ne&shy;crotic damage (your choice) equal to half your priest level. This feature can be used only once per casting of a spell.

#### Clarity of Will
At 20th level, you are able to harness your focused will, improving your Pain Suppression. Your suppression barrier now reduces all damage taken.

While a creature is under the effect of your suppression barrier, it also has advantage on saving throws to avoid being charmed or frightened.

### Holy
The most adept priests leave their houses of worship to serve on the battlefield, as shepherd to flock. There, they use their holy powers to bless allies and mend wounds.  And while most stay behind the frontlines to aid their comrades, these holy champions are also capable of smiting foes and carrying out sacred justice.

Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Healing Prayer
At 6th level, the divine enery of your faith can empower healing spells. Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you rolls dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, you can spend 1 faith point to reroll any number of those dice once, provided you aren't incapacitated. You can use this feature only once per turn.

#### Holy Nova
Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal radiant damage to the attacker. The damage equals your priest level.

#### Guardian Spirit
At 20th level, you can call upon a spirit to guide a fallen ally back to  their body.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Shadow
The brightest light casts the darkest shadow -- and from within this blackness, a rival power dwells. Shadow priests fully embrace this opposing polarity, their faith equally resolute as their holy counterparts. Like all priests, they dedicate much of their lives to worship -- but they derive their power from the Void, straying dangerously close to the domain of the Old Gods.

##### Shadow Calling Spells
| Priest Level | Spells                      |
|:---:|:-------------------------------------|
| 1st | arms of hadar, dark void |

Also at 1st level, when you damage a creature with a priest cantrip, you may deal additional psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

\columnbreak

 - A creature takes necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier when it hits you with a melee attack or if it touches you. 
 - You spells ignores resistance towards necrotic and psychic damage, and creatures immune to necrotic damage are considered resistant.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Dominant Mind
Upon reaching 14th level, you can use your telepathic voice to overwhelm the minds of others. As an action, you can spend 6 faith points to cast *dominate beast* or *dominate person* on a creature within 30 feet of you. 

Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed.

#### Surrender to Madness
At 20th level, you can embrace the mad whispers of the void and let their powers flow through you.

When you use your bonus action to shroud yourself in your shadowform, or as a bonus action while it is active. You can submit yourself to the void for the shadowforms duration and grant the following benefits:
 - When you would normally roll one or more damage dice for a priest spell of 5th level or lower, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.
 - You can use your reaction when a creature that you can see targets you with an attack or spell, piercing its mind with the ramblings of the old gods. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell DC or be incapacitated until the start of your next turn.

At the end of each of your turns while Surrender to Madness is activate, you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 10 + 1 for each successful save), or take half your hit point maximum in psychic damage as the madness overwhelms you and ends your shadowform.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Rogue
*You're gonna find a number of outfits that covet our skills. Adventurers, SI:7... heck, even the disorganized rabble wouldn't mind a spy or two inside Stormwind. But you remember this: You're your own man. Don't let nobody bully you into doing something you don't wanna do! Besides, we hold all the cards... at least, we do before the game's done.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Jorik Kerridan* &nbsp;</div>

Signaling for her companions to wait, a female orc creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools to pick it in the blink of an eye. Before disappearing into the shadows as her warrior friend moves forward to kick the door open.

A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.

Suppressing a giggle, a gnome silently sneaks up behind a guard, lifting the key ring from the his belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.

Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

<br>
<div style='margin-top:430px'></div>

### A Simple Code
For rogues, the only code is the contract, and their honor is purchased in gold. Free from the constraints of a conscience, these mercenaries rely on brutal and efficient tactics. Lethal assassins and masters of stealth, they will approach their marks from behind, piercing a vital organ and vanishing into the shadows before the victim hits the ground. Rogues can dip their weapons in paralyzing toxins that render foes unable to defend themselves. These silent stalkers wear leather armor so they can move unencumbered, ensuring that they land the first strike.

With the rogue’s poisons and speed, the first strike is often the last step before the killing blow.

Rogues fend for themselves, looking for fights in which they dictate the terms. They’re the shadows in the night that remain unseen until the right moment comes to strike, then they dispatch an opponent with quick blade work or a deadly toxin snuck acutely into the bloodstream. Rogues are opportunistic thieves, bandits, and assassins, but there’s an unparalleled art to what they do.

### Skill and Precision
Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.

When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.

### Creating a Rogue
As you create your rogue character, consider the charac-ter's relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past, or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves' guild master? or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventurers, or some other desire or ideal?

What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend, who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.

#### Quick Build
You can make a rogue quickly by following these sugges&shy;tions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make intelligence your next highest if you want to excel at Investigation. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction.

\pagebreakNum

### Finishing Move
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to exploit the weak&shy;nesses in a foe. Once per turn immediately after you hit a creature with a weapon attack that has the light or finesse property, you can use your bonus action to make a second attack with a weapon you're wielding against the creature and perform a combo move. On a hit, you perform a known combo move of your choice as well as dealing normal weapon damage for the attack. You do not add your ability modifier to the damage of this attack.

You start knowing three such combo moves: Eviscerate, Expose Armor, and Rapture. You learn more combo moves as you gain levels in this class.

The amount of extra damage dealt by your combo moves increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Vigor column of the Rogue table.

Some of your combo moves require your target to make a saving throw to resist the move's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Combo save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Dexterity modifier

</div>

#### Eviscerate
Your attack deals an extra 1d12 damage to the target for each point of vigor.

#### Expose Armor
Your attack deals an extra 1d4 damage to the target for each point of vigor, and weapon attacks against the target have advantage until the start of your next turn.

#### Garrote
Your attack deals an extra 1d6 damage to the target for each point of vigor, and the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be unable to speak until the end of its next turn.

### Secret Missives
During your rogue training you learned how to conceal messages, instructions, and simple ideas in plain sight. You do so by weaving subtle jargon and motions in seemingly normal dialogue, sharing statements with hidden meanings or even by writing cryptic code.

You can use 4 hours to share a set of such rules with another creature, allowing you to weave secret messages and commands in your conversations and letters. More elaborate rules may require an Intelligence check at your DM's discretion.

### Cunning Action
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

### Roguish Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an area to specialize yourself within, that shapes your rogue abilities: Assassin, Outlaw, or Subtlety, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your specialization choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

\columnbreak

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Cheap Shot
At 5th level, you learn how to strike at an enemies weakest point. When you make a combo attack, you may choose to perform a cheap shot on the target as your combo move. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of your next turn.

### Evasion
At 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an *ice storm* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Fleet Footed
Starting at 10th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor.

### Reliable Talent
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Blindsense
Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creatures within 10 feet of you.

### Anticipation
At 15th level, you are always surveying your enemies and looking for openings. In combat, you get a second reaction that you can take once per turn. You can use this second reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can't use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.

### Elusive
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

### Stroke of Luck
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively. if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Roguish Archtypes
Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directi-ons, embodied by the rogue specializations.

#### Vendetta
Beginning at 9th level, you are able to make the most of an opportune moment. When you take the Attack action on your turn and score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you may make another weapon attack as part of the same Attack action.

Additionally, when a target that you can see within reach is hit by a critical weapon attack made by another creature, you may use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that target.

#### Venomous Wounds
Upon reaching 13th level, when you use your Envenom combo move and successfully poison a creature, the creature gains disadvantage on one ability saving throw of your choice until the start of your next turn.

#### Seal Fate
At 17th level, you have become a master of instant death. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the damage of your attack is doubled.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Outlaw
You hone your skills in larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, pirates, and other criminals typically follow this specializa-tion, but so do rogues who prefer to not fight fair, using dirty tricks to gain the upper hand in combat. They care little for discretion, and happily engages in brawls head on.

#### Riposte
Beginning at 9th level, you have become quick and deadly with your weapons. Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with an attack, you may deal 1d4 damage to the creature. This damage is dealt as the damage type of a melee weapon you're wielding.

#### Misdirection

\columnbreak

### Subtlety

At 17th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts by succeeding on a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the mind reader's Wisdom (Insight) check.

Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic.

## Shaman
*The wolves are not tamed, not as you might understand the word. They have come to be our friends because I invited them. It is a part of being a shaman. We have a bond with the things of the natural world, and strive always to work in harmony with them. Warlocks would term them spells, but we shamans simply term them calls. We ask, the powers we work with answer. Or not, as they will. I can call the snows, and wind, and lightning. The trees may bend to me when I ask. The rivers may flow where I ask them to.*
<div style="text-align:Right">

*— Drek'Thar of the Frostwolf clan*  </div>

An orc clad in loose plates chained together stands atop a lonely peak, the winds picking up around him, rattling through the chains of his armor, before he releases a glist&shy;ening bolt of lightning toward his enemies.

A gray haired dwarf slowly lumps his way across the battlefield, emptying a bottle of water into the earth as he walks, before lifting it from the soil, and gently waves it over the body of a wounded ally, soothing his grave wounds.

A human sprinting through the thicket, a pair of massive wolves of spectral vision running at his side. In the flash of a moment he howls as his body turns into a wolf of similar visage to his pets.

Shamans are mortal mediators between the elements themselves. Often a spiritual guide in their community, these mystical figures may commune with ancestral spirits and weave elemental powers into their spells. Both to strengthen and heal their allies, and to strike down on the battlefield with devestating force. Shamans can imbue their weapons with the elements, smite their enemies with storm and fire, and summon forth elementals to their aid.

### Herald of the Elements
A Shaman's bond to their magic is unique. While a mage would study it in great depth, and a warlock would bend those same power to their whim, a shaman calls upon the elements themselves for aid. They commune with forces not strictly benevolent -- sometimes they may respond, and sometimes they may choose not to. The elements are chaotic, chained away in their elemental plane as they rage against one another with unending primal fury. It is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos.

These masters of the elements can also call upon ele&shy;mental forces directly, unleashing torrents of lava and bolts of lightning against foes. The elements can create, destroy, support, and hinder. An experienced shaman balances the vast spectrum of these primordial forces into an array of diverse abilities, making shaman versatile adventurers and valued members of any group.

### Respected and Feared
Since the early days of mortal life both Azeroth and Draenor, the elements of have been both feared and wor&shy;shiped. Mystics have sought to commune with them, to tap into the raw power of earth, air, fire, and water. In time, these spiritual guides have come to understand that the depth and gravity of the powers they wield. That the ele&shy;ments are not wholly benevolent, but rather a torrent of neverending conflict, as the elemental lord vie for control. The calling of the shaman is as a conduit of these volatile energies, leveraging them both to heal and to harm.

### Creating a Shaman
When creating a  shaman, consider how your bond with the elements have affected your personality and your view of the world. Although shamans resonate with all four primary elements, some tend to outwardly display aspects of one over the rest. 

Shamans who lean towards fire might be impatient, temperamental, or bursting with energy in all they do. Shamans who lean toward water are adaptable, chaotic, and tend to go with the flow. 

Those who favor earth are typically lawful, stalwart, and stubborn. And shaman who favor air are often aloof, distant, and  the most neutral in their arbitrations. 

Think about your bond with your totems and how they represent the elemental planes from which you gain your power. Are they simply tools to you for channelling raw planar power, or are they sacred and worthy of reverence? 

Do they act as representations of a favored element, or do you use them to keep that element in check? How a shaman perceives their connection to the elemental planes is often reflected in the totems they summon forth.

<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

### Kalimag
You know Kalimag, the language of elementals. You can speak the language and use it to leave messages in rocks and pools of water that only you and other shamans spot. The messages are spoken as through a *sending* spell, with the limitations that come of that spell.
<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

### Spellcasting
Drawing on the elements themselves, you can manifest them into casting spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the shaman spell list.

#### Spell Slots
The Shaman table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a spell slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

\columnbreak

### Totemist
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to channel elemental forces into a Small totem in an empty space on a horizontal surface within 15 feet of you. 

The totem is a magical object that occupies its space. It has an AC of 15 and a number of hit points equal to twice your shaman level. It is immune to poison damage, psychic damage, and all conditions. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). The totem disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 minute. You can dismiss it early as a bonus action.

You can use your reaction to cause the totem to activate if you are within 60 feet of it and choose one of its powers to take effect. Your totem starts with two such powers: Elemental Resistance and a power determined by your Elemental Attunement. Your totem gains an additional power at 3rd level, determined by your shamanic binding.

You can use your Totemist feature twice between rests. You regain all spent uses after finishing a short or long rest. You can summon an additional totem between rests when you reach 10th level, and again at 18th level.
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

At 9th level, you gain resistance to lightning damage.

<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

At 9th level, you gain resistance to fire damage.
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

### Shamanic Binding
At 3rd level, you choose a shamanic binding, shaping your approach to the forces of the elements. Choose Elemental, Enhancement, or Restoration, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 14th, and 20th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Spirit Beast
At 5th level, you earn the favor of a spirit beast and are able to assume its spectral visage. Choose a Medium or Small beast without a fly or swim speed to represent your spirit.

You can use your action to assume the illusionary visage of your spirit beast. This visage has no effect on your game statistics except changing your movement speed to 50 feet.

You remain transformed until you cast a spell, make an attack, or use your bonus action to revert back to yourself.

### Totemic Projection
At 10th level, you are able to channel elemental forces into a totem at greater lengths, increasing the distance at which you can summon your totem to 30 feet and while you are within 60 feet of your totem, you may use a bonus action to move the totem to an empty space within range as if you had summoned it anew.

Additionally, you are able to manifest simple yet effective spells through your totem. You can use your action to cast a shaman cantrip with a range of 5 feet or more through the totem, as though you were in space of the totem.

### Far Sight
Beginning at 13th level, you are able to hone your sight and focus it upon a creature that you have seen before. By performing a 10 minute ritual, you can attempt to cast the *scrying* spell without providing material components. Roll a percentile dice, if the result is less than your Shaman level, you cast the *scrying* spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Shamanic Binding
Shamans strive to deepen their understanding and connec&shy;tion with the elements, often forming a bond with it for life. Some prefer a more brutal approach as they rein in the powers of fire and earth for physical combat, or the forces of fire and air to fight at range. Others in turn, prefer a subtle approach of peace and meditation, bending water and air to their will. You attune with one of these groups.

### Elemental
Through careful study and dedication, elemental shamans are able to channel the volatile energy of the Elemental Plane into destructive magical surges. Through their body flows bolts of lightning, as if from storm, and bursts of fire, as if from molten earth. To battle an elemental shaman is to taunt the very forces of nature.

#### Totem Power
When you choose this binding at 3rd level, you gain the following Totem Power.
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

#### Binding Spells
Your attunement to the Elemental Plane infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. You learn additional spells connected to your Elemental Attunement when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in your elements Spell table. The spell counts as a shaman spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of shaman spells you know. These spells can’t be replaced when you gain a level in this class.

#### Echo of the Elements
At 6th level, when you roll damage for a shaman spell, you may reroll a number of dice up to your Wisdom modifier and use either roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Primal Sanctuary
Upon reaching 14th level, elemental creatures of the world sense your connection the Elemental Plane and become hesitant to attack you. When an elemental creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your shaman spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack auto&shy;matically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

#### Ascendance
At 20th level, you can assume the form of an elemental ascendant. Using your action, you undergo a transforma&shy;tion. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits.

- You gain immunity to damage dealt by the damage type of your elemental attunement.
- When you reroll a dice with your Echo of the Elements feature, you add both dice results to the spell's damage.
- You can use your reaction when hit by a melee attack to cause the attacker to take damage of your elemental attunement's type equal to your shaman level.

***Elemental Strike.*** When you take the Attack action, you can spend 1 maelstrom point to wreathe your attacks in the element of your Elemental Attunement until the end of your turn.

### Restoration
Some shaman find serenity in the restorative properties of water. They do not seek the Light or turn to the divine, yet they feel a profound spiritual connection to the source of mortal life. So strong is their connection to water that the shaman may draw on its power to restore life and heal afflictions, like a tidal wave across a sandy shore. They balance their charge with the other elements, striving for balance and harmony.

#### Totem Power
When you choose this binding at 3rd level, you gain the following Totem Power.
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

***Totem Power: Riptide.*** You can activate this totem when a creature within 15 feet of it casts a spell or uses an ability that restores hit points, causing the totem to riptide onto a creature of your choice within 15 feet of it. That creature regains hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.

#### Ancestral Guidance
Starting at 3rd level, your restorative spells are guided by the hand of your ancestors. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature and roll a 1 or 2, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

#### Nullifying Forces
At 6th level, you are able to draw upon the elements to disrupt the spellwork of others. When you cast a spell that targets a friendly creature, you may also attempt to end one spell effect that is currently affecting them. If the spell slot of the effect is of equal or lower level than spell slot of your spell, the effect ends. Otherwise you must make a Wisdom check (DC 10 + the spell's level) to end it.

You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:30px;'></div>

#### Elemental Boon
Upon reaching 14th level, you can use your bonus action to grant a creature within 30 feet of you a boon of your Ele&shy;menetal Attunement. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can call upon the element and gain its benefits.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Air.*** The creature can call upon this boon when it is targeted by a weapon attack, making the attack roll miss. The creature can use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effect of the roll is applied.

***Earth.*** The creature can call upon this boon when it is hit by an attack, gaining a number of temporary hit points equal to your shaman level. These hit points lasts until the end of the next turn.

***Fire.*** The creature can call upon this boon when it is hit by a melee attack, to wreathe the attacking creature in fire. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take fire damage equal to your shaman level.

***Water.*** The creature can call upon this boon when it is targeted by an attack or spell. Until the end of the next turn, the creature cannot be targeted by any attack or spell and the attacking creature must choose another target or lose their action. The creature still takes damage from things such as a *fireball* spell.

#### Wellspring
At 20th level, you become a fount of restorative energies through the forces of the Elemental Plane. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instad use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12 hit points.

## Warlock
*Imagine what you could do if you led a group of shaman who controlled the source of their powers, instead of begging and scraping for it. Imagine if these shaman had servants who could also fight on your side. Servants who could send your enemies fleeing helplessly in terror. Suck their magic dry as the insects in the summer suck blood.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Gul'dan* &nbsp;</div>

An imp skitters behind her as a young human clad in robes smiles warmly, weaving magical charms into her honeyed words, bending the palace sentinels to her will.

A brutish orc waves his hand in the air, sparking flames of green and red, with a flash of his hand, he hurls a ball of fel infused fire against a night elf.

Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the rough drawn glyphs made in the dirt. A wild eyed forsaken begins a slow chant, as a demonic gate erupts from the ground.

Warlocks and seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through their powerful fel magic and secret grimoire, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. They draw on powers often forbidden throughout Azeroth to bolster their own power.

### Dark Arts, Dominance
In the face of demonic powers, most adventurers see death and destruction. Warlocks see only opportunity, dominance is their aim, and have found a path to it in their shadow magic. These voracious spellcasters enslave demon as their minions to fight and protect besides them. The power of their enslaved demons strengthens as the warlock does, making them able to summon deadly demons to their aid.

<br>
<div style='margin-top:484px'></div>

### Wielders of Fel
warlocks are the wielders of the destructive fel magic, a form of magic often used by demons and members of the Burning Legion. It is a form of magic that is demonic, entropic, and extremely chaotic. Its practice has been banned throughout most regions of Azeroth, and is not something even warlocks dare practice openly, yet it is still practiced by most warlocks in secrecy.

Whilst other forms of magic comes as a natural source from the wielder or is granted by the spirits, fel magic is a bargain, it corrupts the minds of those surrounded and affected by it, and desecrates the land it touches. If their demonic companion was not enough to frighten common folks of Azeroth, the knowledge of the fel powers they wield are enough to discourage service to them.

### Delvers of Secrets
Warlocks are the most volatile and insatiable of spell-casters. Though they often pledge themselves to the service of noble causes and are not innately evil, their desire to understand darker magics and exercise unwavering command over demonic forces breeds mistrust among even their closest allies. Warlocks peer into the Void without hesitation, leveraging the chaos they glimpse within to devastating ends in battle—their greatest abilities are fueled by the souls they’ve harvested from their victims. 

They exploit powerful shadow and fel magic to manipu-late and degrade the minds and bodies of their enemies. They employ hellish fires to rain from the skies, immolating their opponents. summoning and commanding indomitable demons from the Twisting Nether to do their bidding, or even to be sacrificed as the Warlock sees fit, empowering and protecting the dark caster from harm.

Warlocks are defined by the powers they wield, the power-ful fel that the have studied, granting them knowledge of powers hidden to mages and arcanists.

#### Embrace of the Great Dark
You gain a grimoire from the Great Dark Beyond. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. The cantrips are warlock spells for you and don't count against your cantrips known.

Additionally, you learn one spell of your choice from any class's spell list. The spell must have a level equal or lower than your shadow magic's spell level. You can cast that spell once per long rest without expending a spell slot. When you receive a replacement grimoire, you may change this spell to another from any class's spell list.

#### Embrace of the Twisting Nether
You learn to summon and bind a demon from the twisting nether to serve as your companion. With 1 hour of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of charcoal and herbs, you summon your choice of an **imp, voidwalker, succubus** or **felhunter**, each of which are described in Appendix C at the end of the book. 

Your demon gains all the benefits of your Demon Servant ability. You can only have one demon summoned at a time.

If your demon companion is ever slain, you can call forth another using the rules mentioned above.

You can dismiss the demon companion permanently any time you choose, using 1 minute, or you can temporarily dismiss it to a pocket dimension. You can recall the demon from the pocket dimension, as an action, to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

## Fel Study
Warlocks have come into contact with the powerful fel, studying its uncontrollable energy. Three such studies exist, each delving into a different aspect of the powers wielded by warlocks.

### Study of Affliction
Warlocks that study affliction become masters of shadow-touched powers, unlike priests of the shadow priesthood, warlocks delight in the use of fel as a force to cause pain and leaving their enemies in whirls of torment.

#### Expanded Spell List
Affliction lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

##### Affliction Expanded Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                   |
|:---:|:---------------------------------|
| 1st | fog cloud, mind blast            |

#### Curse of Agony
Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. The target is cursed for 1 minute. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:
 - You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target equal to your proficiency bonus.
 - Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Nether Ward
At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against attacks and to use an enemey's failed strike as an opening for yourself. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Unstable Affliction
Upon reaching 10th level, when you deal damage to a crea-ture under the effects of your Curse of Agony, you can use your bonus action to attempt to afflict it. The target must succeed on a saving throw against the chosen affliction. 

On a failed save, the creature gains the effects of the corruption until the end of your next turn.
 - ***Weakness (Strength Save).*** Weapon attacks deal half damage and Strength saving throws are made with disadvantage.

\pagebreakNum

<br>

\columnbreak

 - ***Graceless (Dexterity Save).*** Attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws are made with disadvantage.
 - ***Illness (Constitution Save).*** The creature can't regain hit points and Constitution saving throws are made with disadvantage.
 - ***Stupidity (Intelligence Save).*** The creature must use its action to use their bonus action or movement.
 - ***Negligence (Wisdom Save).*** The creature uses its movement on its turn to move towards you by the most direct route possible.
 - ***Abhorrence (Charisma Save).*** The creature becomes frightened of you, and uses its turn to move more than 60 feet away from you if possible.

#### Seed of Corruption
At 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm of the horrific twisting nether. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.

Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in the eternal cosmos of the twisting nether. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion around it.

You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.

### Study of Demonology
Warlocks that study demonology harness the powers of the malefic demon beings of the twisting nether. Uncovering secrets unknown by residents of Azeroth, and twisting their magic with the aid of demonic powers from the great dark.

#### Expanded Spell List
Demonology lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

##### Demonology Expanded Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                 |
|:---:|:-------------------------------|
| 1st | charm person, sudden awakening |
| 2nd | find steed, mind blast         |
| 3rd | animate dead, slow             |
| 4th | charm monster, dominate beast  |
| 5th | hold monster, planar binding   |

#### Fiendish Influence
Starting at 1st level, you learn the *friends* cantrip, which counts as a warlock cantrip for you.

Additionally, fiends have difficulty harming you. If a fiend targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (a fiend needn't make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of *fireball*). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, poten-tially wasting the attack or spell. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. A fiend is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or harmful spell.

#### Wild Imps
Upon reaching 6th level, your spells are able of open rifts into the twisting nether to bring forth wild imps. Each time you roll a 20 on the d20 roll for a spell attack, or deal the killing blow to a creature of significant threat (DM's discre-tion). You summon an imp in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. A statblock can be found in Appendix C.

A summoned imp obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are inca-pacitated or absent, the imp acts on its own.

Imps stay for 1 minute before being dragged back to the twisting nether. You can have a number of imps summoned equal to your proficiency bonus.

#### Demonic Resilience
Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.

#### Mark of Service
At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect fiends minds. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated fiend. That creature is charmed by you until a *remove curse* spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, you use this feature again, or 24 hours pass.

You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane.

### Study of Destruction
Warlocks that study destruction meddle with the energy of fel and fire, combining the two to create devastating spells. They require little motivation for the havoc they wreak, and are happy to revel in the destruction they cause, thrilled at any opportunity to watch the world erupt in discord.

#### Expanded Spell List
Destruction lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

\columnbreak

##### Destruction Expanded Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                      |
|:---:|:------------------------------------|
| 1st | burning hands, witch bolt           |
| 2nd | aganazzar's scorcher, scorching ray |
| 3rd | erupting earth, flame arrows        |
| 4th | fire shield, wall of fire           |
| 5th | flame strike, planar binding        |

#### Ignite
At 1st level, as an action, you can magically ignite a flam-mable object you touch with your hand.

#### Chaos Magic
Starting at 1st level, whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals fire or necrotic damage, you can use your bonus action and choose a creature hit by your spell. Volatile magic erupts in a 10 feet radius around the target, dealing fire or necrotic damage equal to your warlock level to all creatures within range.

#### Havoc
Starting at 6th level, you can duplicate certain spell effects. When you cast a spell with a spell slot that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you may choose to target a second creature in range with the same spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Soul Fire
Beginning at 10th level, you gain the ability to use your tapped life to empower your spells. Whenever you use your Life Tap feature, you are able to reroll a number of damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier for the next spell you cast within 1 minute.

#### Chaos Bolt
At 14th level, you are able to hurl a roaring bolt of chaotic energy towards a target. As an action, choose a creature within 120 feet of you, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. Taking 7d8 necrotic plus 30 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

A creature killed by this feature and everything it is wear-ing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by *True Resurrection* or *Wish*.

Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you have finished a long rest.

## Warrior
*Now, watch them attack me. Pitiful! Do they think to take vengeance for their fallen? Do they come to challenge ME? I, who have won a hundred wars? I, who stood alone against thousands and still shouted for my enemies to come? No, these saurok will crumple before me like paper before the flame!*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Skeer the Bloodseeker* &nbsp;</div>

A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield high before her as she charges toward the massed kobolds. A night elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the kobolds with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The dwarf nearby shouts orders, helping
the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.

An orc in chainmail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and his companion in a swift action, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a blood elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.

A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd's delight, and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning forth to smite him.

### Ancient Practice
For as long as war has raged, heroes from every race have aimed to master the art of battle. Warriors combine strength, leadership, and a vast knowledge of arms and armor to wreak havoc in glorious combat. Some protect from the front lines with shields, locking down enemies while allies support the warrior from behind with spell and bow. Others forgo the shield and unleash their rage at the closest threat with a variety of deadly weapons. 

The warrior’s battle cries embolden friends and leave foes cowering in fear. With legendary precision, warriors target the smallest gaps in armor and slice at ham- <br> strings in a blur of steel. Every dragon slain, <br> corrupted tyrant toppled, and demon <br> banished from Azeroth has trembled in <br> the face of these lords of war.

Warriors are the quintessential fearless <br> fighters on the battlefield, and their pure martial <br> prowess inspires courage in allies and despair in <br> enemies. Experts in all manner of melee weaponry and possessing incredible physical strength and skill, Warriors are perfectly suited to serve as frontline combatants and battlefield commanders.

### Well-Rounded Specialists
Warriors learn the basics of all combat styles. Every warrior can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a warrior is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on protection their allies from mortal blows, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some prefer a single large weapon able to be wielded with extraordinary force. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.

### Creating a Warrior
As you build your warrior, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane fighters around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication?

You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught -- unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms. Or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions -- the only things that stand between you and death's embrace.

#### Quick Build
You can make a warrior quickly by following these sugges&shy;tions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution.

<span style="margin-left:60px"></span> than once, even if you later get to choose again.
<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

#### <span style="margin-left:15px"></span> Defense
<span style="margin-left:10px"></span> While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack made with a melee weapon that you wield with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. 

#### Protection

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Second Wind
You can draw upon your stamina to protect yourself from harm. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend 1 hit dice, as if you had finished a rest, and regain hit points equal to the total + your Constitution modifier.

### Inner Rage
At 2nd level, you learn to fight with overwhelming ferocity in battle and can harness that fury into your attacks.

#### Rage
You gain 1 rage point whenever you deal damage to a creature with a weapon attack that you did not spend rage points on. You can spend these rage points to fuel various maneuvers. To use one of these maneuvers, you must expend rage points equal to its cost. You can never have more rage points than your Warrior level.

Your accumulated rage points remain for 1 hour before dissipating and returning your pool of rage to 0.

#### Rage Maneuvers Known
You start by knowing three maneuvers: Charge, Disarm, and Raging Blow. Each of which are detailed below.

The Maneuvers Known column of the Warrior table shows when you when you learn new rage maneuvers of your choice. Your maneuver options are detailed at the end of the class description

Additionally, when you gain levels in this class, you can choose one of the maneuvers you have learned and replace it with another maneuver you could learn at that level. You can not change Charge, Disarm, or Raging Blow.

\columnbreak

#### Rage Reserve
You can use a bonus action on your turn to tap into your inner reserve of rage and gain a number of rage points equal to the Rage Reserve column of the Warrior table.

Once you use your reserve of rage, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Maneuver Saving Throw
Some of your rage maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effect. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Rage save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Strength modifier 
</div>

#### Rage Maneuvers
You start by knowing three rage maneuvers:

***Charge.*** When you take the Dash action, you can spend 1 rage point to charge. If you move at least 20 feet toward a target you can make one weapon attack against it as part of the Dash action, this attack is made with advantage.

***Disarm.*** You can spend 2 rage points before making an attack roll to attempt to disarm the target. If the attack hits, the target loses grip on one weapon their wielding (your choice). The weapon falls to the ground in it's space.

***Raging Blow.*** When you roll damage for a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 or more rage points to reroll 1 damage die for each rage point spend. You must use the new roll.

### Martial archetype
At 3rd level, you choose a martial archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose Arms, Fury, or Protection, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 20th level in this class.

### Action Surge
Starting at 6th level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once per turn.

### Indomitable
Beginning at 10th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

## Martial Archetypes
Different warriors choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.

### Arms
Arms warriors are forged not in the classroom, tavern, or workshop, but in the dueling pits and on the arena floor. These warriors are patient fighters, waiting to capitalize on moments when their opponent is left exposed. Many arms warrior gravitate towards two-headed weapons, weapons that allow them to deliver devastating, overpowering blows, fully exploiting their enemies’ weaknesses.

#### Overpower
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to use your weapon as a barrier. When you are hit by a melee attack, you can use you reaction to roll 1d10 and add the total to your Armor Class. If your overpower causes the attack to miss you, you can make one weapon attack against the target as part of the same reaction.

You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Dauntless
At 3rd level, your rage is replenished even as you pour it into your attacks. You regain 1 rage at the end of your turn if you hit a creature with a rage move during it.

#### Commanding Shout
Starting at 7th level, you are able to command an ally to attack your quarry. As a bonus action, choose a friendly creature within 60 feet of you who can see or hear you. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make <br> one melee weapon attack.

#### Colossus Smash
Upon reaching 11th level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you are able to sunder their defenses and give the next weapon attack made against the target before the end of your next turn advantage. You can only sunder a target's defenses once per turn.

#### Deadly Calm
Starting at 15th level, you instinctively enter a defensive stance when things get rough. While you are below half <br> of your hit point maximum, you have advantage on any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw you make.

#### Opportunity Strikes
At 18th level, you respond to openings in enemies defense with unmatched ferocity. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature's turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can't use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.

\columnbreak

### Fury
Fury warriors are among the most feared of combatants, these fearless fighters venture into the fray with a lust for battle, disregarding their own defense to deliver punishing blows with brute force. Many fury warriors favor weapons capable of being wielded in one-hand to unleash a flurry of attacks carving their opponent to pieces.

#### Rampage
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to rampage. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

#### Fearful
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill if you don't already have it and when you make an ability check with it, you can choose to use your Strength modifier instead of your Charisma modifier for the check.

#### Single-Minded Fury
Starting at 7th level, your brutish strength allows you to wield weapons with might unmatched by other warriors. 

When you wield a weapon that deals a single damage die, the damage die of the weapon is increased by 1. For example, a shortsword that normally deals 1d6 damage instead deals 1d8 damage. A weapon's damage die can't <br> be increased beyond a 1d12.

#### Thirst for Blood
At 11th level, when a hostile creature within 20 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards the creature without provoking oppor&shy;tunity attacks. If this movement brings you within reach of the creature, you may make one weapon attack against the creature as part of the reaction.

#### Devastating Critical
Beginning at 15th level, when you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you gain a bonus to that weapon’s damage roll equal to your level in this class.

#### Frothing Berserker
At 18th level, if you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points and doesn't kill you outright, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious and immediately take an extra turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

\pagebreakNum

### Protection
Protection warriors demonstrate a knack for the use of a shield, nullifying opponent’s advances and creating oppor&shy;tunities for counterattacks. For them, being the toughest soldier on the front means nothing if allies are left vulner&shy;able to the enemy's attack. These stalwart defenders are integral to the success of any military campaign. 

#### Taunt
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can use your action to taunt creatures within 30 feet of you. Any creature of your choice
within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Rage save DC or have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Anger Management
At 3rd level, your rage is renewed by blows made against you. When a hostile creature hits you with an attack, you immediately gain 1 rage point. You can only benefit from this effect once per turn.

#### Intercept
Beginning at 7th level, when a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to intercept the attack, forcing the attack to target you instead.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all spent uses after finishing a long rest.

#### Softened Blows
Beginning at 11th level, even the strongest of blows will not fault your defense. Any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit and you have advantage on any check or saving throw made to avoid being knocked prone.

#### Inspiring Presence
Starting at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When you use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its save against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.

#### Never Surrender
At 18th level, whenever you start your turn below half of your hit point maximum, you gain 1d10 + your Constitution modifier temporary hit points. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.

## Rage Maneuvers
If a rage maneuver has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the maneuver at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

#### Berserker Rage
You can use your action and spend 3 rage points to end one effect that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

\columnbreak

#### Bloodthirst
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 3 rage points to bolster yourself in the moment. When done, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Warrior level. These hit points lasts  for 1 minute.

#### Cleave
*Prerequisite: 6th level*
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 4 rage to attempt to cleave another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, roll damage for it as if it was a normal attack. 

#### Deep Wounds
*Prerequisite: 6th level*
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 2 rage points to attempt a deep wound. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or lose 1d4 hit points due to blood loss. The deep wound lasts for 1 minute.

At the end of its turn, the target loses another 1d4 hit points. It then makes another Constitution saving throw, ending the bleeding on a successful save.

#### Execute
*Prerequisite: 6th level*
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 6 rage points to make your attack into a critical hit. This has no effect if the attack roll was already critical.

#### Forceful Blow
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 2 rage points to attempt to force a target back. If the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 10 feet away from you.

#### Hamstring
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 2 rage points to attempt to knock the target down. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.

#### Ignore Pain
You can use your reaction and spend 3 rage points when <br> hit by a weapon attack to give yourself resistance towards bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the start of your next turn.

#### Mortal Strike
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 2 rage points to attempt to deliver a mortal blow. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be unable to have hit points restored until the start of your next turn.

#### Shield Slam
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 2 rage points and use your bonus action to slam the target with your shield, dealing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. 

To do so, you must be wearing a shield.

# Prestige Classes
Prestige classes offer players a way to delve into uniqie class options, classes that are not so easily taught or learnt. The Death Knight requires the aid of the powerful Val'kyr, and a personal sacrifice to be made, a sacrifice of blood, and the Demon Hunter, Illidan's elite soldiers, requires more than a simple blood sacrifice, it requires cunning actions to be taken, personal scars to be made that will last the characters life.

Both classes are powerful in their own ways, and both will grant the individual features unique to them. They each require the player to complete special tasks, a brief description of the tasks are presented in the class Prerequisites. For a more indepth look of what must be done, see Appendix D at the end of this book.

### Joining a Prestige Class
In order to join a prestige class, you must first check with your Dungeon Master. A DM can opt to include or disallow prestige classes in their game. Prestige classes require you to undertake specific actions in the game so that your character can begin pursuing that class. If those actions aren't alreaady possible in your campaign, talk to your DM about integrating the prestige class that interests you.

A prestige class uses the normal rules for multiclassing (See chapter 5, "Customization Options," later in this book). When your character is ready to advance a level, you can choose to gain a level in a prestige class. Your levels in all your classes, including prestige classes, are added together to determine your character level.

#### Prerequisites
Taking up a prestige class through multiclassing involves meeting certain prerequisites, just as with multiclassing into a standard class. You must meet the ability score prerequisites for your current class and for the prestige class in order to qualify for it.

<div style='margin-top:50px;'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A prestige class requires a minimum character level and a minimum score in at least one ability, as well as requiring that you complete a specific deed before being able to take up that class.

#### Experience Points
Just as with the standard rules for multiclassing, the experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class.

#### Hit Points and Hit Dice
Each prestige class specifies the hit points you gain from it. You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes and prestige classes to determine your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you pool them together.

#### Proficiency Bonus and Proficiencies
Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. A prestige class specifies whether it grants proficiencies when you enter it.

#### Prestige Class Features
You gain prestige class features just like normal class features. Sometimes, a prestige class can improve features you have gained from other classes. If a prestige class grants Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, or Unarmored Defense, that feature is treated the same way as if you had gained it from multiple standard classes.

#### Spellcasting
The Death Knight prestige class grants spellcasting. It provides details on how to determine your overall spellcasting ability, using the rules for spellcasting and multiclass character.

## Death Knight
*A hero... that's what you once were. You stood against the shadow, and purchased another dawn for this world at the cost of your life. But the evil you fought is not so easily banished, the victory you claimed not so easily held. The specter of death looms over this world again, it has found new champions to bring about its final reign. Knights of darkness, this is the hour of your dark rebirth . . .*

<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— A knight of the Ebon Blade* &nbsp;</div>

A human clad in heavy armor, wielding a greatsword with both hands, as he clutches it close, runes flash along its edge, leaving a stream of black smoke behind his swings.

An orc surrounded by kobolds, forces his axe into the ground as the earth around him wither and die, frightening the kobolds as they run for their life.

Biting cold rushes through the battle, as a lone blood elf walks forward, her armor clad in a layer of frost, she walks with firm steps, freezing the earth beneath her feet.

No matter their past calling, death knights serve the powers of death, wielding weapons infused with runes of power. They are ruthless and practical warriors resurrected by the powerful val'kyrs and granted the powers of the revered death knights of the Ebon Hold. Although these warriors seem dead at a glance, they are very much alive.

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:489px'></div>

### Outcast for Life
Although these death knights are not undead as the genera-tions before them, they carry much of the essence of the knights that came before them, and from a distance have the look of a dead person, their blank white stares peering at the world around them. Even though they are alive and not emotionless, it means little to most they meet who shun them because of what they have become. Death knights are bringers of death and destroy, a fact not easily forgotten.

This has lead most death knights down a solitary path, many keep to the outskirts of towns and cities, or hide their appearance well before entering.

### Grim Revival
Being resurrected as a death knight is not a simple task, only complicated further by the scar it leaves on the newly resurrected, gaining the powers of the death knights weak-ens the soul for a tremendous time, a price that has to be paid. But not only does it drain the death knight, some scars are visible for all to see, their resurrection has filled their body with necrotic energy that will forever linger with-in them, a trait always shown through their eyes, which will forever sit as two white lights in their sockets.

### Steadfast Warriors
Death knights are exceptional warriors, and in many ways similar to paladins, being keen with various weapons and able to fight in any armor, aiding their combat with the use of magic. They wield their empowered runic weapons and shadow magic which enables them to overpower most foes that would dare to stand against them, making them fearful fighters able to stand in any situation.

### Becoming a Death Knight
For most, becoming a death knight was not a choice, the vast majority of death knights was raised by the Lich King and enslaved under his control, very few remain of the death knights that was freed from his control. Because of this very few new death knights are made, as death knights does not wish to give other their fates, living a live without feelings, in constant battle against the Lich King's ever present control. Necromancers cared little for what death knights wanted, and in secret studied incantations and rituals that would make them able to gain the powers of the revered death knights. Eventually they succeed and crafted a dark simulacrum, detailing complex spells that would allow them to gain the powers of a death knight, without the sacrifice of death, and outside the Lich King's control. To this day their efforts has been eliminated and their simulacrum lost to time.

As you choose to use the simulacrum to become a death knight, consider why you decided to undergo the transfor-mation. Did you seek greater power that what was offered in the living world? Were you seeking a means to end the scourge? Perhaps you were simply curious as to the tomes spells and did not know what you were entering? Perhaps you were sick of your previous life, and wished for a new beginning?

Think about what effect the transformation has done to you, becoming a death knight comes at a cost, it splits a fragment of your soul, forever changing part of you, while these death knights are still alive, the resurrection often changes how one acts, if not for the memory of having sacrificed yourself, then the necrotic energy now rushing through your body.

\columnbreak

#### Equipment
The death knight prestige class does not grant any special equipment.

### Lingering Death
You have been resurrected by a val'kyr in an unholy ritual, twisting your body and giving you the following benefits.

#### Dead Gaze
You gain darkvision to a range of 120 feet, if you already have darkvision it increases by to that range and you are able to see normally in magical darkness.

#### Lost Radiance
Any traces of the holy light have left your body, replaced by unholy energies. Your divine spells becomes twisted if cast, changing the damage of any spell that deals radiant to necrotic damage. Talk with your DM about adjusting the spell visually to better implement this change.

### Rune Weapon
You carve magical runic sockets onto a weapon, binding it to you and preparing it for your runic empowerments. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks. Your rune weapons power fades when not held by you, and its bene-fits can't be used by anyone other than yourself.

You can transform one two-handed weapon or two one-handed weapons into your rune weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon ceases to be your rune weapon if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond.

### Shadow Magic
Your dark resurrection has filled you with necrotic energies that make you able to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for for the death knight spell list.

#### Spell Slots
The Death knight table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your death knight spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example. when you are 5th level, you have three 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell *cause fear*, you must spend one of those slots, casting it as a 3rd-level spell.

\columnbreak

#### Spell Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the death knight spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Death Knight table shows when you learn more death knight spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. For example, when you reach 5th level, you learn a new death knight spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the death knight spells you know and replace it with another spell from the death knight spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your death knight spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cast death knight spell and when making an attack roll with one

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br> your Charisma modifier
</div>

### Presence
At 2nd level, you have gained powers in a presence of after-life, choosing between: the presence of Blood, Frost, or Unholy, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

#### Channel Necromancy
Your presence allows you to channel necrotic energy to fuel dark magics. Each Channel Necromancy option provided by your presence explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Necromancy, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Necromancy again.

Some Channel Necromancy effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your Death Knight spell save DC.

### Runic Empowerments
You have unearthed fragments of magic and learned how to shape them onto your blade in the form of runes to fill its empty sockets with power.

At 2nd level, you gain two runic empowerments of your choice. Your rune options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain levels in this class, you imbue additional runes of your choice, as shown in the Runes Known column of the Death Knight table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the runes you know and replace it with another rune that you could learn at that level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Death Strikes
By 6th level, you are so suffused with negative energy that all your melee weapon strikes carry necrotic power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 necrotic damage.

### Undeath
Starting at 8th level, you can hold your breath indefinitely, and you don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests.

In addition, you age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.

### Antimagic Shell
Beginning at 10th level, you can use your bonus action to end one spell on yourself.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of 1). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Master of Death
At 15th level, you bond with your runic weapons, parting with a fraction of your soul to imbue with in them. If you die, you return to life 24 hours after death, as the weapon resurrects you. IF your body is destroyed, you reform with-in 1 mile of the place of your death. If your equipment was destroyed you do not regain it.

If your rune weapon is broken or on another place of existence, you are not resurrected after 24 hours. If your weapon returns to your plane of existence after 24 hours has passed, you do not return to life as the magic of your weapon fades and vanishes.

## Presence
No matter why one decided to become a death knight, they all feel the drawing to greater powers, most of which are shunned or directly forbidden in most of Azeroth. A death knight feels the presence of these powers and chooses to delve deeper into one of them, expanding his view whilst learning arts which most would see as dark magic.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:200px;'></div>

### Blood Presence
Death knights of the blood presence enter delve into the shunned arts of blood magic, bolstering their own defenses by the use of blood from themselves and draining their enemies lifeforce for their own gain.

#### Channel Necromancy
When you take this presence at 2nd level, you gain the following two Channel Necromancy options.

***Dancing Rune Weapon.*** As a bonus action, you present your rune weapon and manifest an animated copy of your rune weapon. The weapon has the statistics of a flying sword, but deals damage equal to your rune weapon, and has hit points equal to twice your death knight level. It acts on your initiative, its actions determined by you.

The sword lasts for 1 minute, and you can end the effect early as a bonus action, making the the weapon fly back to you and fall to the ground in your space, if you have an empty hand you can instead make the weapon return to it rather than falling to the ground.

***Death and Decay.*** As an action, you can pierce your rune weapon into the ground and use your channel necromancy to desecrate the earth. Each creature of your choice within 20 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or be frightened of you for 1 minute.

A frightened creature must spend its turn trying to move as far away from you as it can, and can't willingly move to a space within 20 feet of you. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from effects that prevent it from moving. IF the creature ends its turn out of sight of you and the desecrated area, it may make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the frightened on a successful save.

#### Rune Tap
Upon reaching 5th level, you can tap your rune weapon's energy to bolster your own defense. As an action you tap your rune weapons power, briefly removing all benefits from your empowerments from it. For 1 minute, you gain resistance towards bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Once the duration ends, you regain the abilities granted by your runic empowerments.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Purgatory
Beginning at 9th level, you don't fall unconscious when you are reduced to 0 hit points and not outright killed, but con-tinue to fight on as normal, making death saving throws at the beginning of your turn.

#### Blood Shield

\pagebreakNum

### Frost Presence
Death knights of the frost presence walk in the footsteps of those that came before them, using cold and ice in a way only matched by mages to do their bidding. They are exceptional combatants able to deliver devastating blows.

#### Channel Necromancy
When you take this presence at 2nd level, you gain the following two Channel Necromancy options.

***Obliterate.*** When you hit a creature with your rune weapon, you can use Channel Necromancy to deal extra necrotic damage equal to 5 + twice your death knight level.

***Howling Blast.*** As an action, you present your rune weapon, and cause a frigid wind to howl past you. Each creature within a 60 feet long and 15 feet wide line from you in a direction you choose must make a Constitution saving throw, on a fail, the target gains one level of exhaus-tion and has disadvantage on attack rolls for 1 minute. 

#### Remorseless Winter

Additionally, you gain temporary hit points equal to your death knight level when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Icebound
Beginning at 9th level, you gain resistance to cold damage. In addition, you can use your reaction and expend your *armor of agathys* spell to give yourself resistance to all damage until the end of your next turn. You regain your *armor of agathys* spell once you finish a short or long rest.

#### Frozen Tomb
Starting at 13th level, you are able to momentarily encase a creature in solid ice. As an action, choose a creature within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 8d10 cold damage and becomes petrified until the beginning of your next turn as ice envelopes it, or half as much damage and it is not petrified on a successful save.

You must then finish a long rest to use this feature again.

### Unholy Presence
Death knights of the unholy presence are shunned by most for their deeds, especially by the Holy Light, they wield ne-crotic energy in a way matched only by warlocks, removing any shred of Holy Light around them as they drain their surroundings of joy and hope.

#### Channel Necromancy
When you take this presence at 2nd level, you gain the following two Channel Necromancy options.

***Control Undead.*** As an action, you target one undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey your commands for the next 24 hours, or until you use this Channel Necromancy option again. An undead whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than your death knight level is immune to this effect.

***Turn the Holy.*** As an action, you present your rune weapon and speak vile words censuring celestials and feys. Each celestial and fey that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed a Wisdom saving throw, or be turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature spend its turn trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only take the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

#### Raise Ghoul
Starting at 5th level, you can cast the *animate dead* spell at will. When you cast *animate dead*, you raise a ghoul rather than a zombie or skeleton. If you cast *animate dead* while you have an undead under your control, you destroy your current ghoul as you cast the spell.

Whenever you create a ghoul using this spell, it has additional benefits:
 - The ghoul's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your death knight level.
 - The ghoul adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.

#### Unholy Protection
Beginning at 9th level, you regain hit points equal to 1d6 + half your death knight level if you end your turn in combat with fewer than half of your hit points remaining and you aren't incapacitated.

#### Dark Transformation
At 13th level, as an action you can surround yourself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 minute. The aura reduces any bright light in a 30-foot radius around you to dim light, and dim light to darkness. You and any creature of your choice in the aura are draped in necrotic shadows. Crea-tures that rely on sight have disadvantage on attack rolls against any creature draped in this shadow.

While active, you can use a bonus action to cause the shadows in the aura to attack a creature. Making a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes 3d10 + your Charisma modifier necrotic damage.

After activating this aura, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Runic Empowerments

#### Rune of Asphyxiate

## Demon Hunter
*The enemy came into our world, desiring to extinguish all life. They slaughtered our loved ones, razed our homes..  our cities. You could not stop them. So you came to me, nothing but rage and determination left, I taught you that what once tormented you could give you power.*

*Now you know, no sacrifice is too great if it brings an end to the Burning Legion*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Illidan Stormrage* &nbsp;</div>

A lone night elf clutching a pair of curved blades, peers to the ground as enemies surround him on all sides, before leaping backwards over the heads of his enemies, swinging his swords at one of them in the process.

A blood elf sprints to the distant aid of her allies, a pair of heavy warglaives in her hands, she releases the fel within, leaving a trail of fel in her path as she rushes in inhumane speed to their aid to jump on the nearest enemy.

A heavily built human standing afar as his allies engage a massive demon, in two swift motions he effortlessly slings his warglaives through the air at the demon, making deep gauges in its hide before returning to his firm grasp.

These hunters have sworn their life to a sacred cause, al-though their motivation may vary, demon hunters are one of Azeroths protectors, these agile hunters carry exceptio-nal skill against the foe they face. They wield both mortal strength and the devastating effects of fel magic, carrying out both with extreme precision

### Feared and Revered
Society often shun demon hunters. Most don't understand the sacrifice that they make, therefore, many choose to become outcasts from their societies. Eyes are commonly turned at them when they wade through towns, most distrust and fear them for what they have become.

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:606px;'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though the world are untrusting of demon hunters, it matters not the the hunter themselves, cause they are protectors of the common folk against threats wishing the destruction of Azeroth, and most importantly demon. They are not righteous like paladins that fight for the Holy Light, or selfless like some rogues and warriors. They are the force who battles evil and although shunned by common folk, their aid is appreciated by experienced fighters.

### Power Granted for a Price
Demon hunters are not trained like warriors are, they are created. It is a harsh and incurable process, leaving scars on the individual that will never heal. Most who attempt to undergo the rites to become a demon hunter end up dying from the horrors of what now possess them, or kills them-selves because of what they have seen. 

At its very core of becoming a demon hunter is the con-sumption of a demon's soul in a ceremony, forever binding it to the demon hunter and suppressing it from taking control through magical inscriptions on the hunters skin, infused with fel. Finishing the binding of soul to the demon hunter by burning out their eyes with a magically imbued blade, forever binding the chaotic soul of the demon to the hunter. Other processes are done to create a demon hunter, slowly creating a fully fleshed demon hunter by removing much of who they were in their past lives.

### Becoming a Demon Hunter
As you choose to become a demon hunter, consider why you decided to undergo their deadly rituals. Were your family slaughtered by demons of the Burning Legion and you seek to avenge them? Did you strive for greater power through fel, and wished to control it? Were you full of rage and anger and wished to put it to use beyond raw strength? perhaps you went through their rituals unwillingly, and by a miracle survived the demons attempts to take control? Think of the demon hunters that put you through the rituals and did the rites on you, your relationship to them, are you angry at them for what they have done? pleased with their accomplishment?

Think about what affect the transformation has done on you, physically as well as mentally. All demon hunters who survive the transformation grows horns, varying for tiny studs to massive horns stretching the length of their head. Some demon hunters grow scales on parts of their body, claws on their hands, or have entire limbs misshapen into a crude limb of a demon being. No demon hunter goes through the rites unchanges, and no two hunters come out with the same mutations, the mutations vary as much as the demon soul which now lives within them. Consider what it has done to your personality. Many demon hunters gains a temper cause of the ferocity of the demon within them, or change personality entirely for better or worse. Think about how the demon bond to you is affected you, if it takes control of your judgement at times, or if you keep it in check at all times.

### Illidari Initiation
Becoming a Demon Hunter is a difficult task, requiring hard training and sacrifices to be made. As a result of this you gain the following benefits:

#### Blind Sight
Your eyes have been torn out, their sockets burnt to see the world in its true form. You lose any darkvision and sun-light sensitivity from your race, and gain the following sight:
 - You are able to see normally to a range of 120 feet. 
 - You are able to see in normal and magical darkness, and can discern colors in darkness.
 - You perceive the world beyond your vision, but it appears blurred, and details can't be discerned.

#### Illidari Fighting
Demon hunters are trained to wield a weapon in each hand, giving you the following benefits:
 - You can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
 - When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
 - You can wield warglaives using either Dexterity or Strength as if they had the finesse property.

#### Felblade Attack
You know how to channel small portions of fel through your strikes. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 fire dam-age to one creature you hit with
an attack if you have advan-tage on the attack roll. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disad-vantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Felblade Attack column of the Demon Hunter table.

### Unarmored Defense
While you are not wearing any armor and wielding a shield, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier.

\columnbreak

### Chaos
Starting at 2nd level, you are able to harness the chaotic energies built up within. Your access to this energy is repre-sented by a number of chaos points. Your demon hunter level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Chaos Points column of the Demon Hunter table.

You can spend these points to fuel various chaotic fea-tures. You start by knowing two such features: Demon's Bite, and Fel Rush. You learn additional chaotic features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a chaos point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended chaotic energy back into yourself. 

Some of your chaotic features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Chaos save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Intelligence modifier
</div>

#### Demon's Bite
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 chaos point to make a weapon attack with each weapon you're wielding as a bonus action.

#### Fel Rush
You can spend 1 chaos point and use your bonus action to vanish in a cloud of fel and teleport from your current position to an empty space within 30 feet that you can see.

### Evasion
At 2nd level, your agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an *ice storm* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Chaos-Empowered Strikes
Starting at 4th level, your weapon attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Demon Wings
Also at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to sprout a pair of leathery wings from your back, making you decent at 60 feet per round. Landing on your feet and taking no damage from the fall.

At 9th level, you can spend 2 chaos points to make the wings capable of carrying you, giving you a flying speed equal to your current speed. While active you can sprout and dismiss the wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last for 1 hour before being unable to carry you any further.

You can't sprout your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

# Chapter 3: Personality & Background
Characters are defined by much more than their race and class. They're individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabi-lities beyond those that class and race define. This chapter expounds on the details that dis-tinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of backgrounds and languages, and finer points <br> of personality and alignment.

<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

## Character Details
Your character's name and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you It's worth thinking about how these characteris-tics reflect the character you have in mind.

### Name
Your character's race description includes sample names for members of that race. Put some thought into your name even if you're just picking one from a list, it may be some-thing you will have to keep for a long time.

### Sex
You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture's expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior. As an ex-ample, a male night elf priest defies the traditional gender divisions of blood elf society, which could be a reason for your character to leave that society and venture on Azeroth.

You don't need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. You could play a female presenting herself as a man, a man feeling trapped in a female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male. Your character's sexual orientation is for you to decide.

> ##### Contrasting Characters
> The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting your character apart from every other character. Consider the following two human fighters.
>
> Hailing from Strahnbrad. Cayla Davenport was a brash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father's trade on the streets of Southshore. When she tried to rob the proprietor of the Inn, the Early Oak, he caught her and took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. After the scourge destroyed the inn, necessity forced Cayla into adventure alongside the friends she'd known from her childhood.
>
> Endrik Goodwin grew up on the streets of Stormwind. He used his wits, strength, and agility to carve out his own territory in the city's shanty town. After several years, he attracted the notice of one of the most powerful thieves' guilds in the city, and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite his youth.
>
> Cayla and Endrik are both human and both warriors, possessing similarly high Strength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends.

\columnbreak

### Height and Weight
You can decide your character's height and weight, using the information provided in your race description or on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what your character's ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy. A weak but agile character might be thin.

If you want to, you can roll randomly for your character's height and weight using the Random Height and Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier column determines the character's extra height beyond the base height. The same number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight Modifier column determines the character's extra weight beyond the base weight.

##### Random Height and Weight 
| Race                 | Base<br>Height | Height<br>Modifier | Base<br>Weight | Weight<br>Modifier |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, as a human, Cayla has a height of 4 feet 8 inches plus 2d10 inches. Her player rolls 2d10 and gets a total of 12, so Cayla stands at 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then the player uses the same roll of 12 and multiplies it by 2d4 pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, an extra 36 pounds (12 x 3) on top of her base 110 pounds for a total of 146 pounds.

> ##### Character Details
> Consider how the names Cayla Davenport and Endrik Goodwin set these characters apart from each other and reflect their personalities. Cayla is a young woman determined to prove that she's not just a kid any more, and her name makes her sound young and ordinary. Endrik Goodwin comes from a the Stormwind province and carries a name of riches.
>
> Cayla is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring career and has auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin with freckles, and a mole on her right hip. Endrik is a small man, compact and all wiry muscle. He has angular features and high cheekbones, and he always seems in need of a shave. His raven-black hair is thick and full, but his eyes are gray and lifeless, betraying the emptiness of his life and soul.

### Other Physical Characteristics
You choose your character's age and the color of his and her hair, eyes, skin, and other racial traits. To add a touch of distinctiveness, you might want to give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.

### Alignment
A typical creature in the world of Warcraft has an align-ment, broadly describing its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitude towards society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Indi-viduals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.

**Lawful good** (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Most paladins, and dwarves are lawful good.

**Neutral good** (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, and most gnomes are neutral good.

**Chaotic good** (CC) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.

**Lawful neutral** (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks, and some mages are lawful neutral.

**Neutral** (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Many humans are neutral.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:200px;'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Chaotic neutral** (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many warriors, and rogues are chaotic neutral.

**Lawful evil** (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. The black dragonflight are lawful evil.

**Neutral evil** (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many goblins, and warlocks are neutral evil.

**Chaotic evil** (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, and gnolls are chaotic evil.

#### Alignment in the Multiverse
For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, orcs, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, these races were giving free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery. 

The evil who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies. Centaurs share a violent temperament, running deep in their blood, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an centaur chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life.

Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A eredar does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn't tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a eredar.

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments, they are **unaligned.** Such a crea-ture is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.

> ##### Cayla and Endrik: Alignment
> Cayla Davenport is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted and striving to help others where she can. Endrik is lawful evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least professional in his approach to murder.
>
> As an evil character, Endrik is not an ideal adventurer. He began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with heroes when he must and when it's in his own best interests.
>
> In most games, evil adventurers cause problems in groups alongside others who don't share their interests and objectives. Generally, evil alignments are for villains and monsters.

### Languages
Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice.

Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that fits in your campaign. With your DM's permission, you can instead choose a language from the opposite factions Language table, an Exotic Languages table, or the language of druids and rogues.

Some languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Kalimag language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elementals.

### Personal Characteristics
Fleshing out your character's personality —the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique identity— will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your charac-ter's favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.

New backgrounds are presented later in this chapter, see also the Player's Handbook and other sources for the full array of available backgrounds for you to choose from. 

\columnbreak

#### Personality Traits
Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. "I'm smart" is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. "I've read every book in Dalaran" tells you something specific about your character's interests and disposition.

Personality traits might describe the things your char-acter likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character's self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.

A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.

#### Ideals
Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the funda-mental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.

Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most impor-tant thing you strive for?

You can choose any ideals you like, but your character's alignment is a good place to start defining them. The back-ground in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the background than with moral or ethical perspectives.

See also the Player's Handbook and other sources for a full list of available backgrounds to choose from.

#### Bonds
Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character's connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character's motivations and goals.

Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?

Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character's history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures.

#### Flaws
Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character's flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What's the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?

## New Backgrounds
Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your warrior might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your mage could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character's identity. The most important question to ask about your background is *what changed?* Why did you stop doing whatever your back-ground describes and start adventuring? Where did you <br>get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

The backgrounds in this chapter are meant as additions to the factions presented in the Player's Handbook, not as replacements for them.

#### Proficiencies
Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills. Skills are described in chapter 6 of the Player's Handbook.

In addition, most backgrounds give a character profi-ciency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook.

If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different profi-ciency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

#### Languages
Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See "Languages" earlier in this chapter.

#### Equipment
Each background provides a package of starting equip-ment. if you use the optional rule from chapter 4 to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.

#### Suggested Characteristics
A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the sugges-tions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.

#### Customizing a Background
You might want to tweak some of the features of a back-ground so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. 

You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in chapter 4. (If you spend coin, you can't also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can't find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your DM to create one.

### Double Agent
You are an informant for an opposing faction or organi-zation, secretly providing them with false information on behalf of another organization in which your loyalty lies. You may be an informant for the Scarlet Crusade, providing them with false intel on behalf of the forsakens. Perhaps you are a member of the Bilgewater Cartel, providing the goblin trade partners with false information to give the cartel the richest scores whilst staying out of their reach.

Discuss with your DM the factions/organizations you are working with and against.

<br> **Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Insight
<br> **Tool Proficiencies:** Forgery kit
<br> **Languages:** One of your choice from the opposite faction
<br> **Equipment:** Forgery kit, dagger, two pieces of chalk, 4 sheets of parchment, one bottle of ink, one quill, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Two Sides of One Coin
You have contacts within both organizations that you provide information to and/or for. Official organizations will often allow you to commit minor crimes without fear of punishment, or run a business without paying all the taxes or fees typically required. Additionally, you can gain an audience with functionaries from both organizations.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Having to work for two sides, hearing each sides story and delivering crucial information false or not. This is not a life for all, often shaping carries to leave personal connections behind, distance themselves from 'close' allies.

|&nbsp; 7       || I hide behind a facade, only showing my true self to trusted friends. |

|&nbsp;&nbsp;d6 |&nbsp;&nbsp;| Ideal |

|&nbsp; 1       || **Selfless** I use my position to help good people avoid prosecution or victimization. (Good) |

|&nbsp;&nbsp;d6 |&nbsp;&nbsp;| Bond |
|:-------------:|:-|:-----------|
|&nbsp; 1       || I got involved in a web of lies to protect the ones I love |
|&nbsp; 2       || I work to undermine an oppressive organization that harms my home. |
|&nbsp; 3       || I was forced into providing information because I was framed, so I found a way to get back a little of my freedom.|
|&nbsp; 4       || My family relies on my support. |
|&nbsp; 5       || I am stuck in dangerous games because of a loved one's poor decisions. |
|&nbsp; 6       || I need to advance in my position within my organization. |

|&nbsp; 3       || I indulge in illegal behaviors whenever possible. |
|&nbsp; 4       || I am pessimistic about everything. |
|&nbsp; 5       || I am vindictive and impulsive. |
|&nbsp; 6       || I am reckless and seek dangerous thrills. |

### Faction Fostered
You were abandoned at birth and found by members of the opposing faction, taken in by a family and raised as a member of their faction. Having had a harsh childhood of being shunned upon by members of the faction, never fully being accepted but merely tolerated in their presence.

You might be a tauren born in the eastern kingdoms, and abandoned by your parents, to be found by human farmers that took you in, nurtured you and raised you as their own, or you may be a human of Theramore, who ran away from your home, to be taken in by orcs and raised as a member of the horde within Orgrimmar, taught how to fight and learn the language of orcs.

Discuss with your DM the details of the faction and race who raised you, as not all races of Azeroth have an equal relationship towards other races.

<br> **Skill Proficiencies:** History, Perception
<br> **Languages:** Two of your choice from the faction you were raised ins faction languages.
<br> **Equipment:** A set of common clothes, hooded cloak, a trinket of your faction, book, one bottle of ink, one quill, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp

#### Feature: A False Allegiance
Your race and appearance makes you able to enter and go undisturbed through villages and cities of both factions, eye may wander upon you as you walk, but none will stop and ask questions, or raise arms against you.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Having lived a life amongst races of the opposite faction, getting to know and love their customs often make faction fostered social skills within their born faction limited. They are nonetheless social individuals, many of which greatly appreciate the races they now have grown up with, and stand by their side against their own kin.

### Kirin Tor Apprentice
You have been accepted into the Kirin Tor, Dalaran's elite cadre of the most powerful wizards on Azeroth. You have spent time within their school, earning yourself a magi mentor to oversee your studies and guide your learning.

You've learnt the basics of the schools of magic, and the ley lines of arcane magic that runs beneath the surface of Azeroth. You've spent enough time within Kirin Tors libraries, learning what knowledge interested you, and have been sent out onto Azeroth by your mentor to seek know-ledge elsewhere, and to gain experience.

<br> **Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, History
<br> **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools
<br> **Languages:** One of your choice
<br> **Equipment:** A bottle of high quality ink, a quill, chalk, a scroll case with 5 pieces of parchment, robes, a candle, tinder box, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp

#### Feature: A Prominent Mentor
You know at least one prominent mage within the Kirin Tor that you can call upon for answers and information. You've learnt a simple but limited spell that makes you able to contact them as long as you are on the same plane of existence. The spell is limited to a 100 word message, and a 100 word reply from the mentor. Once you've contacted your mentor, you cannot contact him again for a week, unless you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher. 

At the DMs discretion, the mentors information may be false, missing vital details, or they may not respond within a timely fashion.

Discuss the details of the mages you know within the Kirin Tor with your DM.

#### Suggested Characteristics
An apprentice of the Kirin Tor is often eager to learn what lies around Azeroth, wishing to learn any knowledge given to them. These apprentices vary drastically in personality, but they all have one thing in common, a deep lying wish for knowledge and understanding of the magic of the world.

|&nbsp; 1       || I am quiet and observant. |

# Chapter 4: New Equipment
The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers and sellers of many sorts:
dwarf smiths and elf woodcarvers, troll charms, goblin relics, and gnome jewelers, not to mention humans of every shape, size, and color drawn from a spectrum of nations and cultures. In the largest cities, almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets, practical swords, and beautiful elven bows.

For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a dungeon or the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the threats that Azeroth presents.

## Starting Equipment
When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of your class and your chosen background. Alternatively, you can start with a number of gold pieces based on your class and spend them on items from the lists in this chapter. See the Starting Wealth by Class table to determine how much gold you have to spend.

You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods that the character purchased during his or her upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon. armor, and a backpack as part of military service. You might even have stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, passed down from generation to generation until your character finally took up the mantle and followed in an ancestor's adventurous footsteps.

##### Starting Wealth by Class

## Wealth
Wealth varies drastically on Azeroth according to region. Coins, gems, trade goods, art object, animals, and property can reflect your character's financial well-being. Members of the peasantry trade in good, bartering for what they need to scrape what gold necessary to pay of their taxes.

Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such as the rights to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold bars, measuring gold by the pound rather than by the coin. 

Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering professional services for hire commonly deal in coins.

### Coinage
Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).

With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.

One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars.

In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces. 

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

##### Standard Exchange Rates
|&nbsp; Coin          | cp   | sp   | ep   | gp    | pp &nbsp;|
|:--------------------|-----:|-----:|-----:|------:|---------:|
|&nbsp; Copper (cp)   | 1    | 1/10 | 1/50 | 1/100 | 1/1000   |
|&nbsp; Silver (sp)   | 10   | 1    | 1/5  | 1/10  | 1/100    |
|&nbsp; Electrum (ep) | 50   | 5    | 1    | 1/2   | 1/20     |
|&nbsp; Gold (gp)     | 100  | 10   | 2    | 1     | 1/10     |
|&nbsp; Platinum (pp) | 1000 | 100  | 20   | 10    | 1        |

</div>

## Shields
The Shield table shows the cost, weight, and other proper-ties of the common types of shields worn on Azeroth.

***Shield Proficiency.*** Anyone can strap a shield to their arm. Only those proficient in the shield's use know how to wield it effectively, however. If you wield a shield that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.

#### Special Shields
Shields with special rules are described here.

***Buckler.*** A buckler is strapped to your forearm, allowing you to hold an item in its hand. If you use the shielded hand as part of an action or bonus action, you loose its increase to your Armor Class until the start of your next turn.

***Tower Shield.*** You use your Strength modifier, instead of your Dexterity for determining your Armor Class while you have this shield donned.

## Racial Weapons
Your race may grant proficiency in special weapons that are crafted and used by your race exclusively. Such weapons include the circular moon swords of the night elves, the engraved tree trunks used by the tauren, and the iconic warglaives used by elves and demon hunters alike.

***Kaldorei Moon Sword.*** Moon sword's are odd circular blades about 2-1/2 feet in diameter with a sharpened edge forming almost the complete circle. These crescent blades are iconic among night elven wardens and are a stable of an extremely skilled warrior.

***Kaldorei Moonglaive.*** Moonglaive's are favored among night elven sentinels. The weapon consists of three equi&shy;distant curved blades that extend from a central handle. 

***Tauren Totem.*** Tauren totem are intricately carved tree trunks. They serve as items of cultural significance as a piece of art and history and a heavy bludgeoning weapon.

***Warglaive.*** Warglaive's are favored by demon hunters. The weapon is made up of two crescent blades that extend in opposite directions from a central hilt.

### Racial Weapon Proficiency
Your race, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain racial weapons. These weapons are **exotic**, and can't be wielded proficiently with simple and martial proficiency.

Proficiency with a racial weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

## Firearms
For tinkers the invention of the crossbow was not enough. They strived to further improve the ability to shoot from a distance without the aid of magic. With the invention of black powder, the dwarves of Ironforge were quick to act in experimenting with its uses, crafting the first firearms from which the weapon has evolved around.

### Firearm Proficiency
Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain firearms, or firearms as a whole.

Proficiency with a firearm allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with them. If you make an attack roll using a firearm with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

A firearm is considered a ranged weapon, and therefore, uses your Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls you make with it.

#### Reloading
Firearms are muzzle-loaded and each barrel of a firearm can only be fired once per turn, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. A firearm can actively be reloaded on your turn by using an action or bonus action.

#### Booming Sound
Firearms make loud noises, a flash of light and a faint smell of burnt explosives when used. A shot can be heard as far as 200 feet away from the shooter.

\columnbreak


#### Gunsmith's Tools
A gunsmuth's tools enables a character to craft, modify and maintain firearms, as well as craft ammunition. It weights 10 lb. and costs 50 gp.

***Crafting Firearms.*** If you are proficient with gunsmith's tools, you can create any firearm of your choice over the course of one workweek (5 days of 8 hours of work) spend&shy;ing gold equal to half the firearms cost in resources.

***Crafting Ammunition.*** If you are proficient with gun&shy;smith's tools, as part of a long rest, you can create batches of ammunition of 6 + double your proficiency bonus. Each batch requires 1 gp worth of material cost.

Some weapons are capable of firing *pellet shells*, special ammunition designed to spread into a volley of shots. You can create batches of pellet shells of 3 + your proficiency bonus. Each batch requires 1 gp worth of materials.

#### Firearm Properties
Firearms have special properties related to their use that are unique to them, as shown in the Weapons table.

***Ammunition.*** Firearms use precisely crafted bullets as ammunition. each time you attack with a firearm, you expend one bullet. There is no means of recovering bullets once they have been fired.

***Multi-barrels.*** You can attack with the weapon multiple times before reloading. The number of barrels the weapon has is indicated in parenthesis.

***Scattershot.*** This weapon can fire special *pellet shells* that spread into a volley of shots rather than a single one, making it easier to hit far away targets with at least one pellet. Targets within the first half of your short range take one extra damage dice and you have advantage on attack rolls made against targets beyond that, up to the weapons long range—which doesn't incur you disadvan&shy;tage. When shooting a scattershot, it deals the damage dice indicated in parenthesis, rather than its normal damage.

***Suppressor.*** The weapon makes no sound and light when used, and thus, ignores the booming sound rules.

# Chapter 5: Customization Options
The combination of ability scores, race, class, and background defines your character's capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and race, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who want to go a step further.

This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for cus-tomizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multi-classing lets you combine classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels.

## Multiclassing
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options. 

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in mage and two in warrior, you're a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely. never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class.

### Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a warrior who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength or Dexterity and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class. having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

##### Multiclassing Prerequisites
|&nbsp; Class   | Ability Score Minimum       |
|:--------------|:----------------------------|
|&nbsp; Druid   | Wisdom 13                   |
|&nbsp; Hunter  | Dexterity or Strength 13    |
|&nbsp; Mage    | Intelligence 13             |
|&nbsp; Monk    | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13  |
|&nbsp; Paladin | Strength 13 and Charisma 13 |
|&nbsp; Priest  | Wisdom 13                   |
|&nbsp; Rogue   | Dexterity 13                |
|&nbsp; Shaman  | Wisdom 13                   |
|&nbsp; Warlock | Intelligence 13             |
|&nbsp; Warrior | Strength or Dexterity 13    |
|&nbsp; Death Knight | Strength 13 and Charisma 13 |
|&nbsp; Demon Hunter | Dexterity 13 and Intelligence 13 |

### Experience Points
The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1 of the Player's Handbook, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a priest 6/warrior 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a warrior or your seventh level as a priest.

### Hit Points and Hit Dice
You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. if the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the warrior and the paladin have a d10. so if you area paladin 5/warrior 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/priest 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d6 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus
Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1 of the Player's Handbook, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a warrior 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies
When you gain a level in a class other than your first, you gain only some of that class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

##### Multiclassing Proficiencies

### Class Features
When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features, however, have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting,

#### Channel Divinity / Necromancy
If you already have the Channel Divinity or Necromancy feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a priest 6 / paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the priest class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

#### Extra Attack
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the warrior's version of Extra Attack or a shaman's wind shield does).

#### Unarmored Defense
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

#### Spellcasting
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

***Spells Known and Prepared.*** You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a shaman 3 / pries 4, for example, you know four shaman cantrips, and four 1st-level shaman spells based on your levels in the shaman class. As 4th-level priest, you know four priest cantrips. If your wisdom is 16, you can prepare six priest spells of 1st and 2nd-level.

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.

***Spell Slots.*** You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the death knight, druid, mage, priest, and warlock classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and shaman classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Spellcaster table found later in this chapter.

If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your Lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like *burning hands*, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned shaman 3 / priest 4, you count as a 7th-level character when—

\columnbreak

determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level shaman spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know.

***Shadow Magic.*** If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Shadow Magic class feature, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Shadow Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast spells you know from classes with the Shadow Magic class feature.

#### Shadow Magic
You determine your available spell slots and the level of those spell slots by adding together all your levels in the death knight, and warlock class. Use this total to determine your spell slots and spell level by consulting the Shadow Magic table found later in this chapter.

##### Multiclassing Shadow Magic:
|&nbsp; Lvl. |&nbsp;|Spell Slots|&nbsp;| Spell Level|

| 1st  || 1 || 1st |
| 2nd  || 2 || 1st |

## New Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, exper-ience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Battlemage feat requires you to be able to cast a spell. If you lose your ability to cast spells somehow you can't bene-fit from the Battlemage spell until that ability is restored.

The feats presented in this book are meant as additions to those presented in the 5th edition Player's Handbook.

### Battlemage
*Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell*
<div style='margin-top:-7px;'></div>

You have improved you technique with spells in the heat of battle, you gain the following benefits:
 - You learn two cantrips of your choice from the mage spell list.
 - When you make a ranged spell attack, you do not suffer disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of the hostile creature.
 - Before you cast an instantaneous spell that requires a spell attack and are unable of hitting more than a single target, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the spell attack roll. If the spell hits, you add +10 to the spell's damage.

### Firearm Expert
You have become excellent at the usages of firearms, gaining the following benefits:
 - You ignore the reload quality of firearms with which <br>you are proficient.
 - Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.
 - When you use the Attack action and attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a loaded one-handed firearm you are holding.

### Firearm Adept
Your have become interested in the mechanical firearms and their uses, gaining the following benefits:
 - Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
 - You gain proficiency in the Tinker's tools.
 - You gain proficiency with firearms.

### Racial Weapon Master
You have practiced extensively with the exotic weapons used by certain races, gaining the following benefits:
 - Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
 - You gain proficiency with racial weapons.

\columnbreak

## Racial Feats
Leveling up in a class is the main way a character evolves during a campaign. Some DMs also allow the use of feats to customize a character. Feats are an optional rule in chapter 6, of the *Player's Handbook*. The DM decides whether they're used and may also decide that some feats are available in a campaign and others aren't. 

This section introduces a collection of special feats that allow you to explore your character's race further. These feats are each associated with a race from chapter 1, as summarized in the Racial Feats table. A racial feat repre-sents either a deepening connection to your race's culture or a physical transformation that brings you closer to an aspect of your race's lineage.

The cause of a particular transformation is up to you and your DM. A transformational feat can symbolize a latent quality that has emerged as you age, or a transformation might be the result of an event in the campaign, such as ex-posure to powerful magic or visiting a place of ancient sig-nificance to your race. Figuring out why your character has changed can be a rich addition to your campaign's story.

Once a creature have reached into the liquid, doing so again yields no additional healthstones until a new soulwell is summoned using a spell slot.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, each healthstone regains an additional 1d4 + 1 hit points for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Spellsteal
*3rd-level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You attempt to steal the effect of a spell from a creature for a brief time. If the spell affecting the creature was cast at 3rd level or lower, the spell effect transfers to you for this spells duration. Once this spell ends, the stolen spells effect returns to the original caster. The time you had the spell counts against the spells original duration. If the spell is of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spells effect transfers to you.

# Variant Rule:  Hero Points
A paladin who stands alone against a horde of undead while his companions heal a dying comrade, a rogue who leaps after a precious artifact dropped from a lofty tower balcony, a warrior who throws himself against a vastly superior opponent. . . These are the heroes whose actions inspire stories and legends.

The actions of a hero often include acts of such a daring nature and chance that it is almost impossible to guarantee a sure outcome. Even though every hero confronts perils, fate is on the side of those who face adversity head on and challenge evil and darkness without fear of death.

Instead of earning inspiration as you venture through the world of Warcraft, you can choose to give your players Hero Points for their daring acts against powerful foes.

Hero points are rewards for that type of valiant action, these points allow a player to bend the fates in his character's favor, and such power requires more hands-on judgement from a DM than most other rules. Hero points blur the lines of action and allow characters to perform the exceptional and even the impossible.

### Gaining Hero Points
The power given by hero points can be immense, your DM can choose to grant you a hero point for your heroic actions. Some adventurers might never earn a hero point, and even when characters does, there is no guarantee that the player will use it when the right time comes. Your DM will tell you how you can earn a hero point in the game.

You either have a hero point or you don't, you can't stockpile multiple "hero points" for later use. Likewise, you cannot earn a hero point through an action that you spend a hero point on performing.

### Using Hero Points
If you have a hero point, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, cast a spell, saving throw, or when being attacked. Spending your hero point makes the check you were an immediate success.

#### Action Surger
You can expend your hero point to make the next turn yours, out of initiative order. Once you've finished the turn, the initiative goes back to normal, and you return to your place in the initiative count.

#### Physical Fighter
You can expend your hero point when rolling for a weapon attack, treating your attack roll as a successful hit. When done, the player chooses one of the following effects:

**Powerful Blow.** Your weapon attack acts as a Massive Critical Hit, roll the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal, and add your character level to the damage.

\columnbreak

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Mutilate.** Your weapon attack mutilates the target, deal-ing normal weapon damage, and attempts to cut off a limb (if any) of your choice. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 12, or half the damage done. On a failed save, the creature gains one of the following mutilations.

 - ***Arm / Hand.*** You cut off the creatures arm, making it unable to hold two items at once, or cast spells while their remaining arm is carrying an object.
 - ***Leg / Foot.*** You cut off the creatures leg, reducing its movement speed by half, and giving opportunity attacks against it advantage. In addition, the creature can't dash.
 - ***Eye.*** You pierce out the creatures eye, giving it disadvan-tage on Perception checks, and reducing its passive Per-ception by 5. If both eyes are removed, or if the creature only has one, it is considered Blinded. This mutilation has no effect if the damage dealt is bludgeoning.

#### Spell Fighter
You can expend your hero point when you cast a spell, treating your spell attack as a successful hit. When done, the player chooses one of the following effects:

**Power Surge.** Your spell attack acts as a Massive Critical Hit, roll the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal, and add your character level to the damage.

**Precision Spell.** You can choose a number of creatures equal to your spellcasting ability modifier to automatically succeed and fail on a saving throw to resist or negate your spells effect.

#### Defensive
You can expend your hero point when you're being targeted by a spell or attack. When done, the player chooses one of the following effects:

**Dodger.** One attack roll made against you that you can see automatically misses, no matter what was rolled.

**Hardy.** You succeed on your saving throw, and gain the effects of rogues *evasion* until the end of the current turn.

#### Survivor
You can expend your hero point after failing a death saving throw, or when suffering from massive damage. Changing your health to 0 and making you stable.

At the DM's discretion you may suffer some signature injury (A scar, lost eye, a limp, and so on) befitting the circumstances, as a reminder that hero points will not always be there to save you.

#### Born Expert
You can expend a hero point before or after rolling a skill check, changing the roll to a natural 20. Hero points can't be used to alter the result of skill checks using Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.

Hero points are meant as a burst of energy or force, they do not suddenly make someone more charismatic, or grant them knowledge of Dalarans vast library.

# Variant Rule: Mana

With this variant rule, a character who has the Spellcasting feature uses mana instead of spell slots to fuel spells. Mana gives a caster more flexibility, at the cost of complexity.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this variant, each spell has a mana cost based on its level. The Mana Cost table summarizes the cost in mana of slots from 1st to 9th level. Cantrips don't require spell slots and there-for don't require mana.

Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast your spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool of mana instead. You can expend a number of your mana to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. Your mana can't be reduce to less than 0, and you regain all spent mana when you finish a long rest.

Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly straining to cast. You can use your mana to create one slot of each level of 6th or higher. You can't create another slot of the same level until you finish a long rest.

The number of mana you have to spend is based on your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Mana by Level table. Your level also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough mana to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so.

The Mana by Level table applies to druids, mages, pala-dins, priests and shaman. A druid (Feral or Guardian), and a paladin refer to the half-caster column of the table, whilst the remaining classes refer to the full caster column.

This system can be applied to monsters that cast spells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that you do so. Tracking mana expenditures for a monster can be a hassle.

# Appendix D: Special Tasks
Prestige classes require special tasks to be completed before a character can enter that class, this Appendix tries to explain the basics of what must be done for someone to become a Death Knight, or Demon Hunter. Bare in mind the information here is a mixture of canon and non-canon lore, and may not reflect how your DM goes about these tasks. 

## Death Knight Task
**Complete a Special Task.** To become a death knight you must find the dark simulacrum and perform the ritual presented in it. At which point you will be reawaken as a weak death knight.

#### Finding the Dark Simulacrum
Finding the dark simulacrum may prove an easy task, or an exceptionally hard one. It all depends on the DM and when they decide to make the item available for you. You might have it from level 1, an heirloom passed down through generations in your family, you may stumble upon it in a warlocks lair, or you might find it in a book store tucked away and gathering dust.

The exact location of the book is a mystery to all but the DM, giving them the ability to implement it in whichever way they see fit.

#### Using the Book
There is not stages to becoming a death knight as there are with demon hunters, the transformation is much quicker and without as much preparation required. Any character able to read Common is able to read the interior of the book, and gain its benefits if they study it for 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer. This is true even if you are not a spellcaster and don't have any innate magic, you will still be granted the secrets of the book.

#### Place of Power
A place of power can be many things, there are not set list of specifics an area has to have to be a place a power, it could easily be a witches workshop, a necromancers demonic alter, or a mages study. These are simple places of power able to be found across Azeroth, but they might not always be available to the player, locked away or hidden. A place of power can be more than a spellcasters workshop. For a night elf it might be the world trees, for an orc the clans communion with the elements, for a human it might be a church to the Holy Light.

A place of power can be more than something magically imbued, or something that has traces of past magic. It can be something icnoic, or with an emotional connection to a race or the player.

#### A Guardian Angel
To complete the ritual the player must call forth a val'kyr from the realm of shadows, these ascended vrykuls are remarkable and extraordinarily powerful creatures, most of whom serve either the titan keeper Odyn or the banshee queen Sylvanas. The called val'kul serves no master, and exists only through the book, should it be destroyed she is bound to the shadow realm for eternity.

The val'kyr's alignment is neutral, and it uses the **deva** statblock, attacking only in self defense.

#### Dark Simulacrum
*Wondrous item, rare*
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

This dark brown tome clad with a silver edge and a runic engraving on its front cover. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, you learn the spells *Runeblade*, *Altar of Power*, and *Summon Val'kyr* as well as how to per-form a ritual with them to gain death knights power, these spells do not take up spell slots but can only be cast once per long rest each. Once the ritual has been done, you lose all memories of these spells. Then the tome loses its magic, but regains it in a year.

#### Altar of Power
*Simulacrum necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour
___
You touch a place of power, filling it with necrotic energy. Until the spells ends, the place of power is desecrated and able to function as an alter able to be used in the sacrificial ritual to gain the powers of the death knights.

#### Runeblade
*Simulacrum enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 hours
___
You touch a nonmagical weapon, imbuing it with runes that runs along its edge. Until the spell ends, that weapon be-comes a magical weapon able to be used in the sacrificial ritual to gain the powers of the death knights.

#### Summon Val'kyr
*Simulacrum conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour
___
You call forth a val'kyr from the shadow realm in an un-occupied space that you can see within range. The val'kyr stays for 1 hour before disappearing again. The summoned val'kyr is neutral to you and your companions, and does not obey any commands you might give it. But is able to sense the presence of a magically imbued runeblade, and a desecrated altar of power.

If the val'kyr is witness to player sacrificing themselves on an altar of power using the runeblade, the val'kyr uses 10 minutes to cast a unique version of *resurrection*, bring-ing the player back and granting them a level in the death knight class. The player gains none of the penalties nor-mally granted by players brought back using *resurrection.*

If the val'kyr resurrects a player, the val'kyr and dark simulacrum vanishes, and anyone who knew how to cast the spells granted by the dark simulacrum loses all memory of how the spells are performed.

Once spell ends, the val'kyr vanishes leaving behind the dark simulacrum and the memories of how to cast the spells within.

## Demon Hunter Task
**Complete a Special Task.** You must find one or more demon hunters willing to lead you through the array of complex rituals required to become a demon hunter.

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

#### Finding a Demon Hunter
Finding a demon hunter willing to lead the player through the various rituals might prove difficult, demon hunters are sparse, and never stay in an area for long before moving on to a new location. Once a demon hunter is found, it may prove difficult to convince them to aid you. They know what the rituals entails, how it affects those who attempt them, how few survive it, and the various sacrifices the player has to make to finish it.

Not just any demon hunter is capable of taking a new initiates through the rituals, and it is not uncommon for multiple demon hunters to aid in the process. In order to undergo the ritual, you need demon hunters with a com-bined level of 20 between them to be able to infuse the player properly with fel magic.

#### Stage 1: Demon Bonding
To begin the process of becoming a demon hunter, the player has to hunt and capture a sentient demon. A demon with an Intelligence above 10, as the ceremony below requires an intelligent being for bonding to work. Captur-ing a demon is a simple task, that could quickly prove difficult for low level parties.

Once a demon has been captured, it has to be brought to the willing demon hunters that is administering the ritual. It is uncommon for the demon hunter to accompany the character in hunting and capturing the demon, as most see it as a test of strength and will. If the player can't complete this task, they are considered unworthy of being given the powers of their kin.

Once ready, the demon hunters present begin to channel fel into the ground around the demon, to capture its soul once slain. Whilst they are channeling, the player is forced to sacrifice the demon, slaying it in whichever way they see fit. After the demon has been killed, the player is given a ritualistic knife, and tasked with carving out the heart of the demon, and collecting a portion of its blood in a flask.

The player is required to eat its heart, and drink its blood while within the fel channeled area, at the end of which the demons spirit will attempt to flee and be captured by the fel magic. The spirit is then placed within the player by the aid of magic, and forever bonded with the player. Even though the spirit is bonded with the player, the player is not yet in control of it, and the demon will try to take control.

#### Stage 2: Visions of Fire
The bond between the player and demon is untamed, the demon will continue to try and take control of the player until it is suppressed.

As the demon bonds with the player, the player is imme-diately shown countless visions in quick flashes, visions of the Burning Legion's crusade, the countless planets they have fought and destroyed across the universe. These visions bring horrors to even the strongest players, many entering a coma or immediately dying as the demon struggles to overthrow the players control.

Shortly after the demon has been bound to the player, after enough time has passed for the player to see the horrors of the Burning Legion, and gained a hatred for what atrocities they have done. 

If the player is still alive, they are once more give the ritualistic knife in their hands, and tasked to carve out their eye sockets. If the player is unwilling or if they are uncon-scious, the demon hunter forcefully removes their eyes. During which the visions that flashed before the player will vanish, sending the player into a coma. Most new demon hunters stay in the coma for a few days, giving the other demon hunters time to finish the rituals. Some new initiates stay in the coma for longer, and about half never wake as the demon took over their mind, devouring their soul and killing the newly made demon hunter.

#### Stage 3: Taming the Demon
Whilst the player is in a coma, the demon hunters continue the rituals on their body to aid in the entrapment and control of their inner demon. During this time the players empty sockets are covered with a piece of thick cloth, the cloth is more symbolic than practical, and helps the demon hunter in social encounters, as their eyes can be frighte-ning at first glance. While the demon hunter is in a coma, flickering green dots begin to appear behind the cloth if the demon hunter is alive.

While the demon hunter is in a coma, their body is infused with deadly amounts of fel magic to aid in controll-ing the demon within, the fel quickly becomes apparent on the hunters body as the fel mutates their body, giving them demonic features such as scales, horns, or claws. The fel also fuses to their body in the form of rough hard lined tattoos, these tattoos are fused with fel magic, functioning as a prison for the demon within.

These rituals are tiresome, and take place over multiple hours, slowly shaping the demon hunter, granting them their demonic appearances and slaving the demon within to the hunters will. Once the rituals are done, the hunters eyes will begin to flicker as green embers behind the cloth, a trait that will continue till the demon hunters death.

#### Stage 4: Reawakening
If the player survives, they will eventually be pulled out of their coma, and wake up to find their body changed. The tattoos placed upon their body will begin to shine with the faintest of light in the color of their paint. The embers in the sockets will flicker behind their cloth cover, and show as green flames bursting out if the cloth is removed. The flames are warm but harmless.

The majority of demon hunter takes years to master their new found powers, taking time to adjust to their new way of life, and the constant influence of the demon within them. While the demon is trapped and unable to take control, its presence will forever be there and be felt by the hunter, always attempting to entice the hunter to join the Burning Legion, an offer many hunters have taken up, only to meet a fate worse than theirs.

> ### A DM Note
> This is but my interpretation of how a player would become a demon hunter, and are meant more as a guideline than rules. You can change them, remove or add more as you please.
>
> You may have realized mentions that a large amount of Demon Hunter dies, but never any saving throws that the player had to go through. Although the player should be aware that few survive these rituals, this is not meant as a potential death for that player.

This has been a project made by a group of people who have loved the Warcraft franchise for many years at this point, and wanted to bring it into Dungeons and Dragons for everyone to enjoy.

This has been a blast for us to make, and we thoroughly enjoy making it and improving upon it. We hope this will bring joy to many D&D tables around the world. Best of luck to all the parties of humans and orcs, try not to chop each other up too much <3
