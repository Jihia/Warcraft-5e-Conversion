## Foreword </div>
We've made this book in an attempt to bring the beloved Warcraft franchise into the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons. It is a task that has taken us months to do, and it'll likely take many more still. Everyone involved are working this in their spare time, aiming to bring a genuine recreation of *Warcraft* as a D&D 5th Edition tabletop RPG.

This book is made to compliment official D&D 5th edition books, including the **Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide**, and **Monster Manual**. It has been built on the framework set by those books, and designed to be brought in as any supplement book would. Without any more work than to just use the material presented.

It has been written with the intention of always being a free resource for everyone to use. Never to be bought or paid for. We've made this because we want others to enjoy the Warcraft universe under D&D 5th Edition rules. Not for any monetary gain.

With each coming update, all changes will be noted in the Changelog â Link is provided below.

# Chapter 1: Bestiary
THERE IS A BIG WORLD OUT THERE. From the familiar shores of Azeroth and the torn reaches of Draenor, across the Twisting Nether to a thousand worlds within the great cosmic planes. It's no wonder so many take to the call for adventure and seek out on the&shy;ir own, and no surprise to hear of the dang&shy;ers they've found along the way.

This chapter presents creatures found throughout the Warcraft universe. Some of the statistics have been brou&shy;ght over or otherwise adopted from the D&D System Reference Document (SRD) under the Open Gaming License (OGL), while the majority were written by the fans and contributors to this project -- without whom this book would likely be a long way away still.

Here you will find statistics for many classic fantasy RPG staples -- skeletons, yetis, owlbeasts, harpies, gnolls, basi&shy;lisks, ghosts, and more -- as well as numerous creatures iconic to Warcraft; such as the insidious murlocs, the lumbering woodland ancients, and the ever-looming threat of the undead Scourge.

If you are looking for material to run a campaign set within the Warcraft universe, whether with material of your own or with material taken from the *Heroes' Handbook* also written as part of this project, we hope this book will provide you with enough material to keep your players on their toes as they venture through Azeroth and beyond.

### This chapter is not yet finished

As of this first release of our *Manual of Monsters*, this book contains statistics for 179 monsters and miscellaneous creatures suitable for a Warcraft campaign.

In the long run, our full goal is a book of statistics for approximately 600 (and perhaps later, even more) monsters, creatures, and NPCs. From mundane beasts to the great Dragonflights and the infernal armies of the Burning Legion, as well as legendary figures.

## Statistics
A monster's statistics, sometimes referred to as its **stat block**, provide the essential information that you need to run the monster.

### Size
A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. See the 5th edition *Player's Handbook* for more information on creature size and space.

##### Size Categories
|&nbsp; Size       | Space | Examples |
|:-----------------|:-----------|:-:|
|&nbsp; Tiny       | 2Â½ by 2Â½ ft. |
|&nbsp; Small      | 5 by 5 ft. |
|&nbsp; Medium     | 5 by 5 ft. |
|&nbsp; Large      | 10 by 10 ft. |
|&nbsp; Huge       | 15 by 15 ft. |
|&nbsp; Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger |

> ##### Modifying Creatures
> Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this block, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak a creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a **variant** or **template**, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.

### Type
A monster's type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an *arrow of dragon slaying* deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as drakonids and drakeadons.

The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.

**Aberrations** are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature's alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quin&shy;tessential aberrations are forgotten ones, nerubians, and beings of the old gods.

**Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.

\pagebreakNum

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Constructs** are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs.

**Dragons** are reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. The dragonflights are highly intelligent and have innate magic. This category also includes distant relatives of the dragonflights; such as the less powerful and less magical  dragonspawns and proto-drakes.

**Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental plane. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of elemen&shy;tal creatures include ascendants, bound and unbound elementals, and revenants.

**Fey** are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. They are closely tied to the Emerald Dream. Fey include dryads, faerie dragons, and wisps.

**Fiends** are creatures of wickedness native to worlds beyond Azeroth. Many originate from the Great Dark Beyond and its Twisting Nether, others were corrupted on planets far away. Fiends all serve Sargeras the Dark Titan, and in turn the Void Lords themselves. Fiends include demons, infernals, and the Eredar.

**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They are enor&shy;mous creatures created by the titans, many of whom still show the stone shapes of their makers. Giants include sea giants, ogres, breakers, and the vrykul.

**Humanoids** are the main peoples of Azeroth, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, orcs, trolls, and dwarves.

A variety of humanoids appear throughout this book, but the races detailed in the *Heroes Handbook* are dealt with in appendix B. That appendix gives you a number of stat blocks that you can use to make variations of those races.

**Monstrosities** are monsters, frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry, and others are the product of terrible curses. They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into any type.

**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They adapt to their environment, taking on aspects of their surroundings.

**Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the ancients and treants. Fungal creatures such as sporelings and the mandragora also fall into this category.

**Titans** are beings made by titans themselves. Many resemble constructs, being massive creatures made of stone or other inanimate materials. Titans include titan constructs, titanforged, and titanic watchers.

**Undead** are once-living creatures brought to a horrify&shy;ing state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as zombies and the Sanâlayn, as well as bodi&shy;less spirits, such as ghosts and specters.

\columnbreak

#### Tags
A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the human&shy;oid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.

### Alignment
A monster's alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, while a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the *Heroes Handbook* for descriptions of the different alignments.

The alignment specified in a monster's stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster's alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned doomguard or an evil keeper of the grove, there's nothing stopping you.

Some creatures can have **any alignment**. Meaning, you can choose the monster's alignment. Some monster's alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.

Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehen&shy;sion of law or chaos, good or evil. They don't make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are **unaligned**, which means they don't have an alignment.

### Armor Class
A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster's AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.

### Hit Points
A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points.

A monster's hit points are presented both as a die expres&shy;sion and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 x 4Â½).

##### Hit Dice by Size
|&nbsp; Monster Size | Hit Dice | Average HP per Die |
|:-------------------|:---:|:---:|
|&nbsp; Tiny         |  d4 |  2Â½ |
|&nbsp; Small        |  d6 |  3Â½ |
|&nbsp; Medium       |  d8 |  4Â½ |
|&nbsp; Large        | d10 |  5Â½ |
|&nbsp; Huge         | d12 |  6Â½ |
|&nbsp; Gargantuan   | d20 | 10Â½ |

A monster's Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).

### Speed
A monster's speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*.

All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster's speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.

Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

#### Burrow
A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can't burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

#### Climb
A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn't need to spend extra movement to climb.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

#### Fly
A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to **hover**, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as ex&shy;plained in the rules on flying in the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

#### Swim
A monster that has a swimming speed doesn't need to spend extra movement to swim.

### Ability Scores
Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they're used in play, see the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*.

### Saving Throws
The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn't easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don't have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.

A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is deter&shy;mined by the monster's challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).

> ##### Armor, Weapon, & Tool Proficiency
> Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.
>
> For example, an ogre typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip an ogre with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the ogre is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.
>
> See the 5th edition *Player's Handbook* for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.

</div>

### Skills
The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

A skill bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster's challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, <br>and Immunities
Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Additionally, some creatures are immune to certain conditions. If a monster is immune to a game effect that isn't considered damage or a condition, it has a special trait.

\pagebreakNum

### Senses
The Senses entry notes a monster's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.

#### Blindsight
A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.

Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or height&shy;ened senses, such as bats and the dragonflights.

If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.

#### Darkvision
A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.

#### Tremorsense
A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.

#### Truesight
A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.

### Languages
The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can't speak it, and this is noted in its entry.

A "â" indicates that a creature neither speaks nor under&shy;stands any language.

#### Telepathy
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can't initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.

A telepathic monster doesn't need to see the creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiative or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can't initiate telepathic contact, and contact is terminated.

A creature within the area of an *antimagic field* or in any other location where magic doesn't function can't send or receive telepathic messages.

\columnbreak

### Challenge
A monster's **challenge rating** tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat monsters that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.

Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.

Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.

#### Experience Points
The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster although the DM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.

Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.

The 5th edition *Dungeon Master's Guide* explains how to create encounters using XP budgets, as well as how to adjust an encounter's difficulty.

### Special Traits
Special traits (which appear after a monster's challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are character&shy;istics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.

#### Innate Spellcasting
A monster with this innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast as its lowest possible level and can't be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster's challenge rating.

An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a spell might have a "self only" restriction, which means that the spell affects only the caster.

A monster's innate spells can't be swapped out with other spells. If a monster's innate spells don't require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.

#### Spellcasting
A monster with the Spellcasting class feature has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as explained in the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*). The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.

The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a particular class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Priesthood feature of the priest or the Druid Path feature of the druid.

A monster can cast spells from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a creature with the 3rd-level *lightning bolt* spell can cast it as a higher level spell if such a spell slot is available.

You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on a monster's spell list with a different spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating. 

#### Psionics
A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn't require any components to cast its spells.

### Actions
When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Action section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*

#### Melee and Ranged Attacks
The most common action that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the "weapon" might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on the different kinds of attacks, see the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*.

***Creature vs. Target.*** The target of a melee or ranged attack is either one creature or one target, the difference being that a "target" can be a creature or an object

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 2 | INTRODUCTION </div>
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PjJ1cuU.jpg' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:-70px; width:770px' />
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/RORo27J.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:-50px; width:900px' />

\pagebreakNum

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Hit.*** any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the *"Hit"* notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.

***Miss.*** If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss that information is presented after the *"Miss:"* notation.

#### Multiattack
A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack ability. A creature can't use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.

#### Ammunition
A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.

### Reactions
If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.

### Limited Usage
Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.

***X/Day.*** The notation "X/Day" means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to use it again.

***Recharge XâY.*** The notation "Recharge XâY" means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.

For example, "Recharge 5-6" means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster's turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5-6 on a d6.

***Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.*** This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

> ##### Grapple Rules for Monsters
> Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn't need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless said otherwise.
>
> A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try and escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster's stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster's Strength (Athletics) modifier.

\columnbreak

### Equipment
A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.

You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, using the equipment chapter of the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*, and our *Heroes Handbook* for inspiration, and you decide how much of a monster's equip&shy;ment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.

If a monster with spellcasting requires material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.

## Legendary Creatures
A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can't. Legendary creatures can take special actions outside their turns, and a few can exert power over their environ&shy;ment, causing extraordinary magical effects to occur in their vicinity.

### Legendary Actions
A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actionsâcalled legendary actionsâoutside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. A legendary creature regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It isn't required to use its legendary actions, and it can't use legendary actions while incapacitated.

### A Legendary Creature's Lair
A legendary creature might have a section of describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Not all legendary creatures have lairs. This section only applies to legendary creatures that spend a great deal of time in their lairs and are most likely to be encountered there.

#### Lair Actions
If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), the creature can use one of its lair action options, or forgo using any of them that round.

#### Regional Effects
The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.

## <span style="margin-left:76px"></span> Ancients

<span style="margin-left:76px"></span> The Ancients are massive, leaf-covered trees
<span style="margin-left:72px"></span> given life. With an unparalleled wisdom and
<span style="margin-left:64px"></span> insight into the world around them, they act as
<span style="margin-left:60px"></span> guardians of the forests where they dwell -- such
<span style="margin-left:60px"></span> as those of northern Kalimdor, where their
<span style="margin-left:46px"></span> shared bonds with the night elves have kept the
<span style="margin-left:32px"></span> two races in a long-lasting symbiosis.

***Staunch Defenders.*** An ancient is grown from an acorn, like so many other trees, though the acorn itself is far rarer and far more powerful. It takes years upon years for an ancient to grow to its full size, where it stays for thousands of years without feeling the wear of old age.

The ancients who have allied themselves with the honorable night elves stand guard of their cities, and of their border territories. They can burrow their rooted feet into the soil beneath, becoming indistinguishable from a normal tree if they stand perfectly still. This allows both for other creatures to take shelter between its leaves, such as a squirrel with its own acorns, and for the ancient to keep quiet watch over the wilds.

Due to their immense lifespan and often slow, lumbering presence, an ancient sees time differently from mortal races. Often times, years may become akin to hours, minutes, or even seconds.

***Plantlike Creatures.*** An ancient doesn't require food or sleep. Instead, it draws nourishment from the soil and can carry on for weeks without a fresh supply of water.

### Ancient Protector
Most often when the acorn of an ancient sprouts, it grows to become an ancient protector. These hulking trees make up most of the ancients, and are critical in safeguarding night elven civic areas and groves.

### Ancient of Lore
Some ancients grow to become enlightened beings of the forest, wise beyond belief and capable of establishing meaningful contact with the free-spirited dryads. These ancient have a close connection to night elven druids and priests, taking on a role as instructors in the ways of magic and the secrets of nature.

### Ancient of War
The toughest of ancients grow into ancients of war; mighty plants often found defending night elven settle&shy;ments or supporting Alliance forces in battle. Embodied in these ancient guardians are the spirits of courage and determination, which they wield to call upon the forest itself to rise in order to turn the tide of battle in favour of them and their allies.

On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

## Basilisk
Sometimes, travelers find carved
<br> stone statues of people or wildlife that
<br> look remarkably lifelike. Sometimes these statues are whole. Other times, the parts that are missing appear to have been bitten off. Seasoned explorers regard such relics as a warning, know&shy;ing that the basilisk resposible is likely to still be close by.

***Territorial Creatures.*** Although basilisks are powerful creatures, and fierce combatants, they rarely exhibit a deliberately cruel or violent intent. Basilisks live as solitary predators, sometimes in small colonies, and keep a watch&shy;ful eye on the borders of their territory. From their domain, they prefer to hunt those who choose to trespass, leaving behind petrified chunks of whatever remains.

***Gaze of Stone.*** As far as predators go, basilisks are often slow and ponderous creatures, as they rarely need to chase their prey. Meeting a basilisk's supernatural gaze can be enough to rapidly transform their prey into stone -- which the basilisk then breaks apart with its strong jaws, perfectly capable of tearing down the stone for nutrition.

***A Fondness for Crystals.*** Though many scholars have examined the basilisk's inherent attraction to crystals, there is no agreement as to why the lumbering beasts exhibit such fondness for them.

They exhibit great fondness for crystalline structures and are capable of sensing them from a great distance, which they will gladly traverse -- in groups or by their lonesome -- to retrieve their coveted prize. Basilisks have such an insatiable hunger for such crystals, it is not uncommon to find colonies that have begun to sprout crystal formations across their rocky hides, as a side-effect of their gluttonous diet.

In Stranglethorn Vale, especially, some colonies have taken to forming their nests from these same crystals, making for an attractive gamble for any adventurers daring enough to come face to face with the terrifying beasts.

## Bog Beasts
A bog beast is a massive, shambling monster made of plants, roots, and flesh. Inhabiting bogs and swamps, they hide away beneath the water surface, disguising them&shy;selves as thick, waterlogged lumps of vegetation. There they wait patiently for any unaware critters to venture too close -- or better yet, unaware adventurers.

***Creatures of Mystery.*** Bog beasts are frightful crea&shy;tures, and notoriously elusive. They are adept at avoiding the gaze of scholars attempting to study them; and for many who have tried, only moss-riddled remains have been found. Their aggressive, territorial nature makes them a considerable danger to any unfortunate enough to cross paths with them.

***Plants Anatomy.*** Thick roots stretch across the entirety of the bog beast's form, as if to conceal what hides under&shy;neath. It is speculated that they have no real need for sustenance apart from the waters they dwell in, and some have been observed spending months still in the murky depths -- only barely grasping the surface to draw breath.

***Naturally Powerful.*** Explorers who have encountered a bog beas and lived to tell the tale, describe them as immen&shy;sely powerful and resilient to harm. Their massive limbs can quickly overwhelm their enemies, crushing opponents with their fists or with whatever nearby objects they can throw.

### Timberling
A timberling is by many considered the child of bog beasts, very similar and yet considerably smaller at a height comparable to that of a dwarf. As far as bog beasts go, timberlings are fairly peaceful creatures that live in harmony with the land. However, any disruption to their habitat will quickly drive them into an unnatural frenzy.

### Thistleshrub
Thistleshrubs, unlike most bog beasts, do not dwell in swamps or marshes. Instead they prefer arid climates, and bear resemblence to a large mass of withered vines cov&shy;ered in sharp briars. They are known to be very hostile, and will certainly attack anyone foolish enough to approach; sporadically lashing out with whip-like thorns at anything that comes near.

### Swampwalker
These hulking masses are rarely ever witnessed outside of dense swamps, and blend perfectly into their chosen habitat with their dark green and brown colors.

They are both the most territorial and the most cunning among bog beasts, and have been witnessed deliberately attempting to lure travellers farther into their lair in order to spring a trap. Their natural camouflage allows them to move through their territory entirely unseen, and have left adventurers wary even of rippling water and rustling leaves when venturing through swamps.

### Tar Creeper
Cherishing humid air and temperatures, the tar creeper is by far the most abormal of all bog beasts for its viscous, tar-like appearance. Not to mention the most dangerous.

Though they might seem slow, these massive beasts can cut through tar like a fish through water; lunging forth to trap their prey and drag it back down below.

## Centaurs
Abundant across the plains of central and southern Kalimdor, the centaur are a race of half-horse humanoids, appearing as a human's torso, arms, and head extending from the neck of an equine body. Full-grown centaurs stand over seven feet tall, hooves to head, and weigh over a ton.

***Nomadic Culture.*** They keep in small nomadic tribes, roaming the broad regions they consider their territory, with regular spots by which they settle their tents to hunt and forage. Each tribe is lorded by its khan, who'll more often than not keep open conflict with both neighboring tribes and races alike.

While on their warpath, travelling from place to place, centaurs often claim prisoners during their raids. Usually, these prisoners are tortured, driven to exhaustion, and eventually eaten.

***Cycle of Conflict.*** Though many attempts have been made, either between tribes or at the behest of tauren settlements in a tribe's warpath, the centaur have never been ones for diplomacy. 

Both the Horde and the Alliance have done their part to feed this inter-tribal conflict, seeing it as a necessary act to keep scattered clans, especially in regions such as the Barrens or Desolace, from banding together and becoming a more dangerous foe.

### Centaur Earthcaller
Though centaurs follow a shamanistic faith, their rites and rituals are unqiue; given their heritage as children of the elemental princess Theradras. Earthcallers are commonly female centaurs, acting as shamans of their tribes as they wield the power to rain elemental earth upon their foes.

### Centaur Khan
At the heart of each centaur tribe is the khan, who acts as leader both for their great intelligence and their unmatched ferocity. Rage and savagery are key to the centaur khans, allowing them to lead their tribe into battle as a fearless commander without equal.

### Centaur Names and Language
The centaur speak Low Common, and often learn phrases from the languages of their enemies; including Common, Orcish, Goblin, and Taur-ahe. A few centaurs  even go as far as to learn the entirety of these languages, with fewer still adopting this second language as their primary language.

Their names are short and sharp, while tribes draw their name from the first khan to lead them -- such as khan Gelk of the Gelkis. The ending of a tribe's name sits at the whim of its first khan, it is speculated that they draw these from other languages spoken by the tribe's founding members.

> ##### The Children of Zaetar
> The centaur are the progeny of Zaetar, a Keeper of the Grove and son of Cenarius; Lord of the forest and Demigod of the Groves. Though Zaetar was no lesser than his brother, Remulos, he often felt himself living in the shadow of his brother's presence and accomplishments.
>
> When Cenarius sent his son Zaetar out to investigate the re-emergence of the elemental princess Theradras, daughter of Therazane the Stonemother, Zaetar saw himself enchanted by Theradras' beauty.
>
> The two became mates, in secrecy, and out of their forbidden union the centaur were born. Zaetar realized his deed upon seeing the centaurs, who in turn saw the disgust in their father's eyes and brutally murdered him. Therazane chastised them for the deed, for which the centaurs promised to honor Zaetar's memory to please their beloved mother.
>
> Theradras entombed her lover's spirit within her own lair, which the centaur gave the name Maraudon and grew to regard as a sacred place.

## Core Hounds
Most who venture to Blackrock Mountain would rather face a squad of orcs than confront a single core hound. These hulking bulldogs drip of magma as they trail, guard&shy;ing the molten core of the black mountain -- as well as the scorched earth of the lands around.

A core hound's body is covered in thick, sweltering metal plates, with streaks of fire running the length of its back. Its mouth is filled with rows of sharp teeth, said to be hotter than white-hot steel.

***Faithful Servants.*** Core hounds are the faithful servants of the Firelord and his minions, and in many ways do act like loyal dogs in that regard, following the will of their fiery master as best they can. 

***Endless Growth.*** If allowed, a core hound can grow for an eternity, ultimately becoming hulking titans of gargan&shy;tuan size -- like their progenitor, Magmadar. Few core hounds ever manage to reach such a size, as often their aggressive nature becomes their downfall.

The dark iron hounds, considered misshapen by true core hounds, cease to grow once they reach maturity.

### Core Hound
The core hound is a monstrous, vicious, two-headed bulldog with a faithful bond to the Firelord Ragnaros and his minions. Waves of scorching heat emanate from the core hound's body, and those who engage it with head-on quickly find their weapons rendered useless as each slash and stab melts it all away.

They are are ferocious, unforgivable beings. Hostility toward intruders is always a given, as they are impossible to reason with. They take orders solely from the Firelord's rank and file, or from the Firelord himself.

### Dark Iron Hound
A dark iron hounds is smaller, one headed, core hound. They are often seen accompanying the dark iron dwarves who dwell within Blackrock Mountain.

These hounds are often used as mounts by the dark iron dwarves that keep them, though they do not take well to others.

## Dinosaurs
Dinosaurs are among the oldest reptiles in the world. For the most part, they split into two groups: savage, territorial predators, and docile but still undeniably dangerous herbivores.

These creatures come in many sizes and shapes, with a wide variety of markings and colorations between them. They roam far and wide across Azeroth, all the way from remote mountain valleys to humid jungles and rugged barren plains.

### Raptor
The raptor is an aggressive theropod predator, known for its great strength and speed. It is fast enough to chase down near anything out in the open, and prefers to pounce on its prey in order to trap it. Then, it tears flesh from bone with its long, curved claws and razor-sharp teeth.

### Threshadon
A plesiosaurus is a marine dinosaur whose compact body is driven by powerful flippers. An aggressive predator, it attacks any creature that it encounters. Its flexible neck accounts for a third of its total length, allowing it to twist in any direction in order to deliver its powerful bite.

## Dragonhawks
Travelers entering the enchanted forests of Quel'Thalas might catch a glimpse of the mystical dragonhawk gliding above the trees. An unusual warmth hangs in the air, as the majestic beast vanishes out of sight.

***Bred for War.*** The elves of Quel'Thalas have a long standing tradition domesticating dragonhawks. They are vicious flying predators, swift and deft, able to crack bones and pierce hides with their long talons, and the elves have long mastered training them for use as aerial mounts. Majestic and magnificent creatures, dragonhawks and their elven riders make for an impressive sight.

***Wild Legends.*** Few wild dragonhawks still exist. Most the beasts found in Quel'Thalas, if not all, are kept by the elves. Wild ones are near-mythical beings that few ever witness, as they stay clear of their tamed kin and have become masters of avoiding detection. These dragonhawks are formidable hunters and among the deadliest predators found on the Eastern Kingdoms.

## Dust Devil
A dust devil is an elemental of air and earth. Roaring out across the land, these violent vortexes can spell a real problem for any  nearby settlements, as their chaotic nature makes them prone to cause great upheaval.

***Eternal Nuisance.*** Dust devils find an unusual enjoy&shy;ment in their uncanny roaming, destroying whatever they come across in their path by sending forth incredible gusts of wind or by tearing it asunder with their hands.

***Conjured by Magic.*** Certain spells and magic items can conjure forth elementals from the Elemental Plane to the Material Plane. Elementals, and dust devils in particular, resent this treatment and the shackles of servitude that comes with it. A creature that summons an elemental must assert the force of will to control it.

***Elemental Nature.*** A dust devil doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Dwarves: Dark Iron
Known for their fiery tempers and fierce determination, the Dark Iron clan of dwarves has a history of strife with the other dwarven clans, as well as within their own ranks. Twisted by the influence of Ragnaros the Firelord, they are a greedy, cruel, and despotic kind.

Most dark iron dwarves have hair as red as fire or black as coal, trickling with ember flakes, and skin the colour of ash. Though their clothes are drab and dark, their ornate style and lavish jewelry is a prominent display of status.

***Legacy of Thaurissan.*** In ages past, the Dark Iron clan cut out their own from the Bronzebeard clan of Ironforge and the Wildhammer clan of Grim Batol. Sworn to revenge on his dwarven king, the Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan and his wife Modgud led their clansfolk to the southern borders of Khaz Modan, into the far-reaching stretches of the Redridge Mountains.

There, founding the city of Thaurissan, the clan let their hatred seethe and and their forces swell, before they ultimately led a two-pronged assault on both Ironforge and Grim Batol. Thaurissan himself was routed by the Bronzebeards at Ironforge and his wife saw her end to the Wildhammers at Grim Batol. The Dark Iron clan fled back to their home in the Redridge Mountains, where they were ultimately cornered by their dwarven kin -- intent to wipe Thaurissan's legacy from the continent.

***Rise of the Firelord.*** To avoid a seemingly inevitable defeat, Thaurissan attempted to summon forth and ancient power that had been left sleeping beneath the earth. What he brought forth was the Firelord, Ragnaros, once locked away by the Titans when the world was still young.

The towering elemental Lord rose forth, unleashed from his prison, in an apocalyptic rebirth that shattered the Redridge Mountains. At the center of the devastation, a volcano rose forth to spew ash and molten rock across the land. This volcano became known as Blackrock Mountain. The smoldering crater of destruction to its north became known as the Searing Gorge, while the lifeless reaches to its south became the Burning Steppes.

Though Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan himself was killed in the eruption, both the legacy of his name and the legacy of his surviving clansfolk have lived on. Enslaved by the Ragnaros the Firelord and his elemental hordes.

***Shadowforge City.*** For decades on after, the Dark Iron clan lived in servitude to their elemental master. Not as thralls in chains, but as devoted warriors under the Firelord's scalding banner. Following on in the footsteps the Sorcerer-Thane's legacy was the son of him and his wife Modgud; Dagran Thaurissan, crowned emperor of the Dark Iron clan and their new home beneath Blackrock Mountain -- Shadowforge City.

<div style='margin-top:290px;'></div>

***Born in Flames.*** Like other dwarves, dark iron dwarves have strong constitution. Adding to their formidable stamina is an incredible affinity to fire -- a gift granted to them by their long servitude to Ragnaros the Firelord. 

Though fire can still harm them, the soot-stained skin of a dark iron dwarf shields them well from the smoldering fires at the heart of Blackrock Mountain.

***Conflicted Kin.*** The dark iron dwarves have long nurtured conflict with the other dwarven clans. A failed coup in Ironforge ignited the War of the Three Hammers, which in turn became the catalyst that ultimately brought forth Ragnaros. Worse still, the dwarves remain as split within their own ranks as they are with the other clans. 

Open conflicts between independent groups and splintered factions is a common occurrence within the blackened halls beneath the mountain.

### Dark Iron Sorcerer
For those among the dark iron dwarves who lack the strength to train as warriors, a few hold the privilige to instead pursue the study of magic. Sorcerers within the Dark Iron clan have unlocked the power to harness their inner fire, and even yield some control of the mountain's elemental forces from their master. This power seats them at the heart of clan.

### Dark Iron Overseer
The Dark Iron Overseers keep the daily operations of the clan's numerous prospects -- both within Blackrock Mountain and out across the surrounding landscape. The Searing Gorge, in particular, has proven beyond valuable for its mithril and truesilver.

As the tireless work of the dark iron work drudges on, the overseers stand with hateful smiles on their faces, cracking the whips that drive their labouring thralls forward.

### Dark Iron Herald
Heralds stand at the pinnacle of dark iron society. They are the voice of their kin, the mouth through which the Firelord enacts his will upon the dwarves. Their presence alone brings forth the fiery temper that has become the clan's legacy; driving dwarves around them to fanatical extremes. 

To this end, they have been bestowed with the power to weave devastating spells and conjure forth the Firelord's minions to their own aid.

## Elementals

Elementals are as ageless as they are unchanging; volatile beings of raw elemental power, manifested in physical form. Since the early days of creation, as life hurdled through the cosmos and manifested itself upon countless worlds, the most common primordial form of life has been the elementals -- who now populate nearly every world spanning across the great dark beyond, nourishing themselves off of the energies within.

***Bound to the Elemental Plane.*** On Azeroth, as the titanic Keepers saw to the ordering of the world, they found the elementals wreaking havoc under the corrupting influence of the Old Gods. As a safeguard, to protect their intended new denizens of the planet from such a destructive force, the Keepers constructed the Elemental Plane as a prison in which the elementals could be locked away, free to roam at their own behest. In their absence, the Keepers could tend to their task at hand; settling the natural order of Azeroth.

The Elemental Plane is divided into four interlinked regions, each existing within its own pocket dimension as a representation of its associated element: The Abyssal Maw, domain of water; Deepholm, domain of earth; the Firelands, domain of fire; and Skywall, domain of air.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:140px;'></div>

***An Eternity of Conflict.*** Though the domains within the Elemental Plane are intended to be sealed off, none of them accessible from the others, the elementals have never ceased their endless strife with one another. By what means they can, whether by breaching the walls of their domain to invade another or by taking their conflict to the physical plane with the help of mortal hands, the elementals are quick to clash as they meet -- sometimes waging battles of titanic proprtions.

***The Ordering of Elements.*** Though elementals are chaotic and violent by nature, some more so than others, they themselves follow a strict ordering of power within their elemental domain.

Above all other sits the Elemental Lords; beings of untamed power, whose sum can be considered even larger than most else existing within their realm. They hold power over their domain within the Elemental Plane, subjugating lesser elementals to carry out their bidding. It is said that if magic drawing power from the Elemental Plane is cast in the presence of the Elemental Lord governing that particular elemental domain, it may well fall to said Lord to take control of the spell at their own whim.

Carrying out the bidding of the Elemental Lords are their lieutenants. While nowhere near as powerful as their respective Lord, it is not uncommon for an elemental lieutenant to wield both great power and agency in carrying out their master's bidding.

***Elemental Nature.*** A elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Air Elemental
Taking form as a swirling storm, or a billowing cloud given faint humanoid shape, an air elemental holds command of wind and weather. Fast and silent, it strikes out by enveloping its foes in a blinding whirlwind to seize the upper hand.

### Arcane Elemental
Appearing in areas suffused with arcane energy, these ele&shy;mentals manifest from its energy and are often found in the service of mages, feeding of the fluctuation of magic from their spells.

### Earth Elemental
Near indistinguishable from rocks if standing still, an earth elemental is as hardy and steadfast as the element it embodies. It burrows through the ground with utmost ease, and faces its opponents head-on if engaged.

### Fire Elemental
A fire elemental manifests as a smoldering pillar of unwavering destruction. While susceptible to water, it is a cunning presence that will often attempt to overwhelm and outright engulf those who try to stand in its way.

### Ice Elemental
Manifest from frozen water, ice elementals share domain and allegiance with other water elementals. It moves unhindered through the icy reaches in which it dwells, and is very quick to enrage at the sight of fire wielded in its vicinity.

### Water Elemental
A favoured companion among mages, human mages in particular, a water elemental is near impossible to discern while underwater. If able, it often attempts to deal with threats by luring them along into the water -- and from there, drag them along into the murky depths.

## Faceless Ones
The faceless ones are a monstrous kin, brought forth from the organic matter that seeped away from the Old Gods in primordial times, before the Titans brought about the ordering of Azeroth. Cunning and intelligent, they serve their eldritch masters with fanatical devotion. Tales of their unspeakable deeds paint them as unstoppable juggernauts.

***Spawn of the Old Gods.*** The faceless ones are the creation of the Old Gods, in the most literal sense of the word. They are shaped from the Old Gods' own flesh and blood; trickled from their eternal prisons through the core of the planet, like bile through the gutters.

Some of these aberrations are unique, while others are so unfirom as to be virtually identical. They are all loyal to the gods that spawned them forth, unwavering in their devotion to the will of their creators.

***Unexpected Allies.*** These eldritch horrors are powerful, but not innumerable. What they lack in either is quickly recouped by corrupting other beings that happen in their path. Even a faceless one on its own is almost guaranteed to never truly be alone.

The faceless ones keep a few valuable allies, such as the Naga, while simultaneously seeding hatred and distrust even among the most loyal of factions.

***Corrupting Presence.*** Faceless ones carry the stain of the Old Gods with the, wherever they go, and their presence alone can change things for the worse. Life is tainted in their wake, slowly twisted around as friends become foes and alliances dissolve into bitter hatred.

Whether by instilling paranoia or asserting dominance directly, the faceless ones will always seek to divide and conquer.

***Return of the Black Empire.*** The Old Gods once ruled over Azeroth, in a time long before mortal races saw the light of day. Locked away by the Titans, they have long ever since to return to power -- an end to which their faceless severants are the means by which they act.

Long have they sown the seeds of corruption, turning the denizens of the world against one another, so that they can break free and seize control once more.

### Zoatroid
Many would see the small, squid-like zoatroid as utterly inconsequential. Nowhere near as dangerous as the towering n'raqi. Fools are those who underestimate them, as these merciless critters hunt to gain complete of their victims -- which they do by latching onto the face of a suitable target in order to bore into its mind.

Zoatroids have found a second home among the Naga, saiding their serpentine allies by infiltrating and corrupting their enemies. Some zoatroids are only able to seize control of a creature's body, while others are able to claim both body and mind as their own.

>
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Magic Resistance.*** The zoatroid has advantage on 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; saves against spells and other magical effects.
>
> <br>The royal zoatroid has the following action option in place of the zoatroid's Enslave:
>
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Dominate (Recharge 6).*** One humanoid grappled 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; by the zoatroid must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; saving throw or be dominated by the zoatroid: the 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; dominated target goes on the zoatroids initiative, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; it controls the target using its action. The *Domi-*
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; *nate* deprives the target of its vision but not its 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; awareness. The royal zoatroid can be targeted by 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; attacks, spells, and other effects but any attack roll 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; that misses the zoatroid automatically hits its 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; dominated target.
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The domination lasts until the target drops to 0 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; hit points, the zoatroid ends it as a bonus action, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; or a creature uses their action to attempt a 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; grapple check contested by the zoatroid.

> ***Enslave (Recharge 6).*** One humanoid grappled by the zoatroid must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be enslaved by the zoatroid; the enslaved target goes on the zoatroids initiative, it controls the target's body using its actions, but it doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The enslave deprives the target of its vision but not its awareness. The zoatroid can be targeted by attacks, spells, and other effects, but any attack roll that misses it automatically hits its enslaved target.
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enslavement lasts until the target drops to 0 hit points, the zoatroid ends it as a bonus action, or a creature uses their action to attempt a grapple check contested by the zoatroid.
>
> ***Fogged Mind (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Each non-aberration creature within 10 feet of the zoatroid must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Reactive Shield.*** The zoatroid forces an attack roll that would hit it to instead hit its enslaved target. To do so, the zoatroid must be able to see the attacker.

In addition, at the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes 7 (2d6) acid damage.

> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitu&shy;tion saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 3 (1d6) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured. A swarm of insect's crawl out of a creature 1d4 rounds after it died if it was diseased upon its death.

## Fleshbeast
Though the exact origin of these monstrous aberrations is unknown, the theories are many. Some even go so far as to claim them a product of the Twisting Nether itself, pulled from there onto other worlds.

***Nightmare Made Flesh.*** Slavering, hungering monstro&shy;sities, the best way to describe the terrifying fleshbeasts are plainly as creatures of nightmare. Their presence has been witnessed both on Azeroth and beyond, as they appear to tail along on magical experiments that try to exploit the powers of the Twisting Nether, using them as rifts through which they can travel between worlds.

***Parasitic Brood.*** Fleshbeasts are decidedly mindless, acting entirely on instinct. They hunt by flocking together in large swarms, overpowering their prey and consuming it, sometimes while it is still alive. Even after the fleshbeast has had its fill, most of the victim will still be left behind intact -- a perfect nesting ground for their wormlike spawn, who will later devour the remains as they hatch.

Other predators attempting to scavenge remains left behind by a fleshbeast will most likely be infected as well, and later devoured by the hatchlings.

## Furbolg
Furbolgs are large, kind-hearted creatures. Resembling humanoid bears, they form tribal settlements in caves, forest thickets, and other defensible locations. Though they have care little for conflict, they appear particularly susceptible to corruption.

***Peaceful Nature.*** Furbolgs are a peaceful race, wishing to live for themselves with as little outside interference as they can. They keep a close tie to nature and worship the ancient bear twins; Ursoc and Ursol.

Their tribes can grow exceptionally large, though they are masters at staying secluded from the world around. A furbolg tribe is its family, and tension within is rare. Most tribes are led by its wisest, oldest shaman.

***Corrupted Kin.*** Perhaps leading to their secluded nature, furbolgs have been shown to be easily manipulated by outside forces. As the lands around have blightened, trubes have been transformed into vicious, hateful packs.

Many such tribes lost their ways to the Burning Legion's invading forces, as well as to the corrupting influence of the Old Gods.  Turned away from their kin and onto a bloody path of war.

> ##### Variant: Furbolg Shaman
> Some furbolgs devote themselves to becoming a shaman for their tribe. A furbolg shaman gains the Spellcasting trait.
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** The furbolg is a 3rd-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following shaman spells 
>
> <br> Cantrips (at will): *gust, produce flame*

## Ghosts
While most mortal souls eventually find their way to the Shadowlands, not all who have died manage to find rest. Some are unwillingly bound to roam the trackless wastes that exist between the Shadowlands and the physical world, appearing in the latter as ghostly apparitions as they search for release from their endless suffering.

***Existing Between Worlds.*** There are many reasons for why a soul would remain. Curses and deliberate magical entrapment are both common, though the most prevalent are souls unwilling to abandon the physical realm -- also known as the Material Plane -- for the realm of spirits. A person whose life ended abruptly at the hands of someone else is very likely to return as a malevolent spectre, seeking to exact revenge upon those who did them wrong.

Conversely, other spirits may be unwilling to find rest out of fear for what lies beyond, or for a feeling that their life never really reached its full potential.

***Bitter Resentment.*** It is not uncommon for ghosts, especially those forced to dwell in this state for too long, to grow resentful of the living. Unable to accept their own death, and envious of those still living, they grow to foster a seething hatred for warmth, hope, and joy. The presence of such may even drive them into a murderous frenzy.

***The Shadowlands.*** Shaped before mortal life even walked the universe, the Shadowlands is a realm of existence spanning all known worlds, including Azeroth. Those who have seen it describe it as a nightmarish world of decay; a labyrinth of intertwined spiritual planes all teeming with the souls of the dead.

Many believe this to be the final destination for all mortal souls. The realm into which they are drawn in death, destined to remain forever after. Others choose to hope for their final rest to be brighter -- more pleasant than an eternity languishing such cold and bleak confines.

Within the Shadowlands, time does not pass as it would elsewhere. Sometimes, years outside of the Shadowlands may only seem like days within. Sometimes, a year passed by within this bleak domain takes little more than a minute, or perhaps an hour, in the physical realm. While it it is often next to impossible to see what lies ahead inside the Shadowlands, it is possible for those within to hear whispered fragments of what is happening outside.

It is said that Icecrown, the frozen peak of Northrend and citadel of the Scourge, exists as an anchoring bridge between the Shadowlands and the physical world.

Some of the most prominent beings dwelling in the Shadowlands are regarded as patrons of death among various races; such as Bwonsamdi, the troll Loa of death.

Also prominent are the Spirit Healers; ascendant Val'kyr who, following the banishment of Helya and the sealing of the Halls of Valor, disappeared into the Shadowlands -- hidden away there, even from the corrupting influence of the Lich King.

> ##### The Spirit Healers
>
> The first of the Val'kyr was the titanic Watcher Helya, bound by the Keeper Odyn to an eternal servitude as the bringer of souls to his gilded Halls of Valor: the golden realm for all slain spirits of Odyn's followers. Her servitude was not willing, but a punishment, and one for which she had let her hatred for Odyn simmer for milennia.
>
> When the Keeper Loken came with a promise of a way out, and subsequently broke her chains, she called upon her powers to bend the arcane energies of Azeroth into an impregnable seal around Odyn's halls, its inhabitants sealed within.
>
> Free from her servitude, Helya forged the mist-shrouded realm of Helheim as a new home for herself and her Val'kyr, though not all chose to follow her on this path. Instead, some chose to break bonds and disappear into the Shadowlands.
>
> There, just as they once guided fallen vrykul to the Halls of Valor, these Val'kyr have dubbed themselves *Spirit Healers*. From their refuge in the Shadowlands, they have kept an eye on those who enter the dark beyond, and have on occasion granted passage back for those they've found worthy.
>
> ***Encountering a Spirit Healer.*** If your adventurers have met an untimely demise and their quest rem&shy;ains unsolved, seeking out a Spirit Healer within the Shadowlands could be an option for them. The Spirit Healer may judge, or other&shy;wise be convinced, that it is not yet their time and return them to the realm of the living.

### Apparition
An apparition is a spectral impression whose presence in the Material Plane has been caught in flux with the latent energies from a nearby ley line or other font of magical power. As a result, apparitions wield the power to weave their anguish and their resentment into powerful, often harrowing spells.

### Banshee
A banshee is the tormented remnant of an elven woman, whose death came to pass in the most gruesome manner -- with the fall of the Highborne, the first coming of the Bur&shy;ning Legion, and the fall of Quel'Thalas all noteworthy events from which banshees have been formed.

Robbed of their elven gift of immortality, the banshees were left to wander the world in tormented silence until they were discovered by Ner'zhul, the first Lich King. In return for a promise of servitude to the Scourge, Ner'zhul gifted the banshees their terrible, blood-curdling voice, which they in turn have used to enact their revenge. 

Though some banshees still roam free in their own lamentation, most remain beholden to their bond with the Scourge. Some banshees, particularly those formed after the fall of Quel'Thalas, have since found new purpose among the Forsaken.

### Shade
Shades are much alike other ghosts, appearing as disembodied spirits left to wander the reaches between the physical realm and the darkness beyond. This, however, is as far as the similarities go.

While other ghostly beings are the remnants of those unwilling or unable to accept death, shades are formed through willing sacrifice: necromancers offering up their acolytes to better serve the undead Scourge.

Empowered by the Lich King, shades can remain unseen if they will it, detectable only by powerful magic. This allows them to act as the eyes and ears of their undead masters.

### Spectre
Much like the banshee, a spectre is the tormented remnant of an elven man, slain by monstrous foes and robbed of their immortality. Though spectres do not possess the anguished screams for which banshees are known and feared, they still remain a considerable danger to those who encounter them.

Driven both by a bitter resentment for the living and by their hubris in death, a spectre may attempt to lure unwary travelers into dangerous traps, waiting for an opportune moment to overpower them and seep away their life force.

### Wisp
Wisps are the disembodied spirits of deceased night elves, made one with the forest in their passing. Unlike other ghosts who wander the world in anguish, wisps use their spiritual being to bridge a connection ever closer to the forests where they delve.

Though silent for all but a soft, quiet humming, wisps are able to communicate with the living. Acting together in unison with the tree-like ancients, they act as guardians and caretakers -- often flourishing around druidic groves.

\columnbreak

### Wraith
Though they are beholden to their masters -- whether they necromantic cults or the undead Scourge -- wraiths are notorious for how they retain most of their intelligence and in&shy;dividuality, even in death. Self-motivated and exception&shy;ally cunning, it is not uncommon for a wraith to act by its own accord, in defiance of its master's plan.

Some wraiths may be found holding to the same sense of honour and law as they did in life, and may even be willing to negotiate with the living if prompted. Other wraiths, meanwhile, offer little more than a jealous rage for those who approach them. Spurred by a resentment for their undead state, these wraiths readily yearn for a chance to visit their anguish upon any unfortunate enough to cross their path.

### Ghost Template
Ghosts are the spectral remnants of intelligent beings who, for one reason or another, cannot rest easily in their graves. A ghost greatly resembles its corporeal form in life, but in some cases the spiritual form can be altered.

When a creature becomes a ghost, it retains its statistics unless otherwise is stated below. The ghost loses any trait that assumes a living physiology.

***Type.*** The ghost's type is undead, and it loses any tags. It no longer requires air, food, drink or sleep.

***Speed.*** The ghost loses its original movement speed and gains fly 40 ft. (hover).

***Senses.*** The ghost has darkvision with a radius of 60 ft.

***Damage Resistances.*** The ghost gains resistance to acid, fire, lightning, thunder; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks

***Damage Immunities.*** The ghost gains immunity to cold, necrotic and poison damage.

***Condition Immunities.*** The ghost can't be charmed, exhaustion, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained

***Ethereal Sight.*** The ghost can see 60 ft. into the Spirit World when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

***New Action: Etherealness.*** The ghost enters the Spirit World from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Spirit World, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.

***Hit Points.*** If the creature already has three or more damage resistances or immunities, its hit points remain unchanged. Otherwise, the creature's hit points are reduced by a multiplier based on its challenge rating. 

Using the Hit Points Based on Challenge Rating table, apply the appropriate multiplier to the creature's hit points to determine ghost's hit point.

#####  Hit Points Based on Challenge Rating
| Creature <br> Challenge Rating  | HP Multiplier |
|:-----------:|:------:|
|  1-10       | x 0.5  |
|  11-16      | x 0.65 |
|  17 or more | x 0.8  |

All other creatures within 30 feet of her that can hear her must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d12) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
> ***Possession (1/Day).*** One humanoid that the banshee can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the banshee; the banshee then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The banshee now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The banshee can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

>
> ### Reactions

## Gnolls
Gnolls are feral humanoids that attack settlements along the frontiers and borderlands of civilization without any warning, though highly aggressive, they are notorious for being extremely unintelligent and prone to infighting.

***Nomadic Destroyers.*** Gnolls are dangerous because they strike at random. They emerge from the wilderness, plunder and slaughter, then move elsewhere. They attack like a plague of locusts, pillaging settlements and leaving little behind but razed buildings, gnawed corpses, and befauled land. Gnolls choose easy targets for their raids. Armored warriors holed up in a fortified castle will <br> survive a rampaging gnoll horde unscathed, even as the towns, villages, and farms that surround the castle are ablaze, their people slaughtered and devoured.

Gnolls rarely build permanent structures or craft anything of lasting value. They don't make weapons or armor, but scavenge such items from the corpses of their fallen victims, stringing ears, teeth, scalps, and other trophies from their foes onto their patchwork armor.

***Intelligent Beasts.*** Gnolls are by no means an intelligent humanoid race, but rather many would call them relatively intelligent beasts. They are known to manipulate each other into fights over ridiculous things like *whose shadow is larger*. Gnolls use as much time to fight with each other as they do when fighting a common foe. The gnolls would be a fearsome race, if they ever stopped tearing each other to pieces long enough to organize into an army.

***Hunger for Meat.*** To a gnoll, meat is meat, and they will gnaw their victims bones clean of anything that resembles meat. Gnolls will even go so far as to kill and cannibalize outcasts of their pack if they are hungry enough. They've also made a tradition of devouring the bodies of their dead.


### Gnoll Brute
The strongest of the pack becomes those who lead it, a gnoll brute displays immense strength far superior to that of most gnolls. A gnoll brute is no more intelligent than any other gnoll, and only has a larger lust for blood.

### Gnoll Mystic
Some gnolls feel a connection towards the shamanistic forces of the world, these gnolls become mystics of their packs. A gnoll mystic is capable of performing simple arts of magic that would be considered novice by most scholars, but even though their feats aren't extraordinary they are held in high regard by gnolls of their pack, seeing them as being the wisest of beings.

### Gnoll Pack Lord
The alpha of a gnoll pack is the pack lord, ruling by might and cunning. A pack lord earns the best of a gnoll pack's spoils, food, valuable trinkets, and magic items. It places ornaments on its body of brutal piercings and grotesque trophies to show its superior strength over the pack.

## Golems
Golems are made from humble materialsâflesh and bones, metal and stoneâbut they possess astonishing power and durability as their creation is wrought with magical energy. A golem has no ambitions, needs no sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no remorse. They are constructs created with a purpose in mind, to follow its creator as a guardian, protecting a person, place, or thing, or as constructs of war created to attack and defend at their creator's orders.

***Blind Obedience.*** These constructs are created to perform the task at hand flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its abilities. When it is unable to fulfill its given orders, a golem might turn to violence, or stand and do nothing until new orders are given.

A golem can't think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can't be reasoned with or tricked with words.

***Constructed Nature.*** A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Arcane Golem
Arcane golems are hulking, magically-empowered golems created to act as peacekeepers and defenders. Their large stone builds boast with magical energies inlaid through their bodies, displaying glows in many different colors.

Arcane golems are a favor construct amongst blood elves for their magical tenacity and are found primarily through Quel'thalas as they patrol the streets, roads, and cities of their kingdom with vigilance.

### Harvest Golem
Resembling a giant scarecrow equipped with razer-sharp metal claws and possessed with blazing orange eyes. That is the visage Harvest Golem. These large and terrifying 'scarecrows' wreck havoc and terror across the fallow fields of Westfall. Where these golems came from or who their creator are is but a mystery to the working folk of Westfall, but their purpose quickly became apparent. These golems are programmed with a simple purpose, to hunt down and eliminate the humans inhabiting Westfall. 

They have brought caution to the fields of Westfall and the many scarecrows that stand atop them, eliciting terror in anyone foolish enough to roam its fallow fields alone.

## Grell
A grell is a small, long-armed forest spirit with pointed ears and accentuated brows. Though their appearance carries an uncanny resemblence to imps, they are fairly large by comparison and lack any of the typical features of a demon.

Among explorers, researchers, and naturalists, it is speculated that the similarities between grells and imps are not coincidental, and that the first imps were in fact grells given into demonic influence during the first invasion of the Burning Legion. Such theories are widespread, but have never been confirmed nor denied.

***Wild Presence.*** Most grells have skin in shades of green, orange, or brown, mimicking the wilderness around their dwelling. Their arms and legs are covered in dense fur, and their hands and feet are all equipped with sharp claws. It is fairly common for grells to fashion themselves simple clothes, as well other adornments -- such as rings for their ears and nose.

Some have speculated as to whether these adornments serve a purpose, such as magical foci for casting spells, or if they are just for decoration.

***Fiendish Personality.*** It is said that the grell exist as an ebodiment of the wild, uncanny side of nature, and their personality shows this notion all too well. Grells on their own pose no particular danger to any would-be travelers, but a gang of grells working together can be a real threat to settlements and communities living close to their dwelling.

The most malicious grell are the ones who choose to roam around in packs, actively searching for straggling travellers to ambush, overwhelm, and steal from. Though their diet mainly consists of moss, tubers, and mushrooms, it is not unheard of for a pack of grells to hunt wild game.

## Harpies
Taking glee in suffering and death, the sadistic harpy is always on the hunt for prey. They are vicious predators that have lured countless adventures to their death, drawing them into the depth of their nest to kill and consume.

A harpy combines the body, legs, and wings of a hunting bird with the torso, arms, and head of a night elf. Its wicked talons and graceful wings make it a formidable threat in combat, and its eyes reflect the absolute evil of its soul.

***Noxious Nests.*** Harpies nest in hard-to-reach places from where they can terrorize the land around them. They slowly destroy the environment in which they settle, killing every creature they encounter and despoiling the land to build nests noted with their noxious order. Active nests are easy to discern by the intolerable smell and rot that protrudes from inhabited nests.

***Precious Collectors.*** These winged humanoids place great value on shiny baubles, valuable objects, rare gems, and ores. They are known to actively trade with nearby settlements to attain anything shiny, procuring a moments calm before they return to ravaging the land around them. The harpies adorn themselves with their shiny baubles and trinkets, as a show of their esteem.

***Beguiling Creatures.*** Harpies resembles malformed night elves combined with features of large predator birds. The sadistic creatures would be considered beautiful when seen from a distance and as they grow in age, they are known to become more beautiful. Growing to resemble formidable and colorful night elves more as they grow old.

Harpies are incapable of producing male children and their eggs will always hatch females. Because of this they have had to count on their cunning and deceptive nature to lure and capture males of many races for them to breed with. The males fill the role for a time, after which they become food for the nest.

### Harpy Witch
Some harpies are capable of wielding the forces of nature at their will. These harpy witches are powerful individuals within their nest, often using their aided forces of nature to rise to become queen of a nest and maintaining the title by tormenting countless enemies and allies alike to stay in their seat of power.

## Kobolds

Diminutive, rat-like, and subterranean, kobolds can be found dwelling in sprawling caverns and abandoned mines across Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms alike. Even throughout Northrend one can find their aptly named cousins; the snobolds. As far back as the first human settlements in the Eastern Kingdoms, kobolds have been a persistent, and annoying, presence.

Kobolds averages at four feet tall, with coarse skin, sharp claws, a pronounced snout, and a spindly tail. Educated guesses have pinned them as a distant offshoot from the troggs, though this has never been deemed certain.

***Skittish Creatures.*** Adventurers who have encountered a kobold, especially a kobold away from its pack and lair, can testify to their notorious cowardice. Kobolds are not particularly intelligent, and many consider them more of a nuisance than real danger -- at least in smaller numbers.

***Massive Flocks.*** Kobolds are not only known to bear a resemblance to vermin; they breed like vermin as well. Wherever one kobold can be found, hundreds more are likely not too far behind. While kobolds aren't considered a threat in smaller numbers, a pack numbering in dozens, even hundreds, can pose a threat even to seasoned adventurers if attempted removed from their dwellings.

They have no concept of marriage, rather, they form a loose structure of packs and clans based on lineages, with young individuals opting to migrate between nests and warrens in search of mates outside of their own family.

Famously, kobolds can become very protective of their belongings, and prefer to keep a distance from other races in order to keep themselves safe.

***Candle-Hoarders.*** Despite living deep underground, populating self-made caverns and abandoned mines -- sometimes even chasing miners away if the pack is large enough -- kobolds do not see well in the dark. They rely on candles to traverse whichever caverns they call home. 

These candles are usually made by the kobolds them&shy;selves, twining wicks from their hairs and pulling wax from their ears, though in desperation a kobold may contemplate stealing candles from other nearby settlements. Once a candle has been acquired, it is placed atop the kobold's head and left to burn there.

***Legends of the Darkness.*** Kobold legends speak of a dark, devouring presence dwelling in the deep places of the world, giving reason to the creatures' candle obsession.

To the same end, some kobold packs have been seen keeping rats as pets, as the critters do not fear the dark&shy;ness themselves. A well-trained rat can keep the kobold company and help out with digging, while a not so well-trained rat can make for a good dinner.

### Kobold Names and Language
Kobolds typically speak Low Common, and often adopt other wide-spoken languages in the regions they dwell. The latter is especially prevalent across the Eastern Kingdoms, where most kobold packs and clans have learned Common over their long history of interacting with humans.

Kobold names and clan names are a descriptive amal&shy;gamation of everyday words. Kobold name usually has two parts; a short, easily vocalized first name, and a descriptive surname. Kobold surnames are personal and not inherited, but rather like a title that sums up their character, appear&shy;ance, or a well-known possession of theirs.

Their clan names often refer to common traits passed down through that clan's lineage, or to quirks unique to their society, though they can be hard to distinguish from the names the kobolds give themselves.

Most herds consists of a small dozen of kodos, but there has been sightings of herds so large as some fifty kodos. A herd leader is often an ancient kodo.

***Tauren Culture.*** The kodo beasts are key to tauren culture. Tauren hunt and use every part of kodos for their equipment, clothing, and food. But also train the mighty beasts as mounts or beasts of burden. The tauren see these creatures as a symbol of vigor and power, and hunting them is an important rite of passage for young warriors.

***Pack Beasts.*** Kodos are formidable pack beasts and are used extensively by the tauren, as well as other races of the horde. The large beasts are capable of carrying immense amounts of load for long period without being exhausted.

## Lashers
A lasher is a large slithering flora that can be found across Azeroth, although most lashers are not hostile, they will defend themselves fiercely if disturbed, using their long tendrils to lash out against their target.

***Sentient Plants.*** Lashers are the result of nature magic having seeped into the ground and corrupting the land around it, granting them the sentience to move on their own and pull themselves out of the earth. 

The magic of the earth affects the lashers tremendously. It has turned many lashers from their peaceful way into very hostile creatures corrupted by the magic around them.

***Adaptive Plants.*** These living plants can be found throughout Azeroth, lashers are capable of adapting to the environment around them to survive and sustain them. The plant their seeds wherever magic is apparent and protect them as the seeds grow into small lashers.

They plant their seeds  wherever possible and protect them as they grow to maturity.

***Fast Learners.*** These plants know near nothing but how to survive when they reach the maturity of their seed and become lashers. But these plants have shown an incredible ability of learning new skills like how to create small pieces of arts, set up and conceal traps, and gestures others might've shown them.

### Lasher Spitter
A lasher spitter is a large carnivorous plant capable of a vile acidic mixture within its stalk, these lashers are easily recognizable by the large maw that makes up the head of the plant. They are able to spit their toxic mixture onto nearby creatures and have it slowly dissolve their flesh.

### Barbed Orchid
A barbed orchid stands out from other lashers by its large flower head with the bead of an owlbeast placed in the flowers center. These lashers make dangerous combatants with their barbed edges striking back at attackers.

### Bloodpetal Flayer
At a glance most would take the bloodpetal flayer for a very colorful lasher, but nothing more. These lashers are much more ferocious and carry a vile toxin within their thorns that burns beneath a creatures flesh when injected.

> ##### Variant: Mature Lasher
> When lashers reach maturity, some learn to channel the powers of the moon in their favor. 
>
> A mature lashers has the same statistics as a lasher spitter, except that it has a Wisdom score of 12, and replaces the spitter's action options with the following action options

> ***Dream Lash.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +3 to hit, range 15/30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d10) radiant damage.

## Leper Gnome
Beneath the snow capped mountains of Dun Morogh lies the halls of Gnomeregan. It was once the capitol of the gnomes, but now its irradiated halls are home only to troggs and the crazed gnomes who survived the culling radiation of their once remarkable capitol.

Leper gnomes are gnomes contaminated by the toxic radiation of Gnomeregan. It has turned their skin a sickly green and dotted with abscesses that burst at the smallest strain they exert.

***A Necessary Sacrifice.*** When the gnomish capitol of Gnomeregan was invaded by hordes of troggs, the High Tinker ordered to cull the city and drive the troggs back by using the radiative waste previously contained within the machines of the city. Many more gnomes were killed than troggs when Gnomeregan was flooded by radiation.

Even worse, though, the gnomes who survived was horribly mutated and driven to madness by the radiation that sept into the city, changing them into what are now know as leper gnomes.

***Insane and Hostile.*** Fractious in groups and individually weak, most leper gnomes continue life in the poisonous halls of their city. Their minds are left crazed by the toxic fumes and have given them a tendency toward paranoia for the troggs which they now share the vast city with. They are hostile towards all intruder who dare enter their city, believing them to be trogg invaders or at best allied with the troggs themselves. Many of the leper gnomes know nothing else than the constant fear of troggs invading, and the few remaining survivors of the culling have lost their minds and memories of any other life.

***Mutated Creatures.*** The radiation has fundamentally altered the leper gnomes into something else and so far no cure to know to counteract the effect on them. The longer a leper gnome spend near radiation the more their body becomes a twisted and devolved. They continue to devolve further until they become mindless puddles of toxic sludge.

> ##### Radiation Disease
> When an uninfected creature comes into contact with a source of radiation, such as contaminated waterâbeing bitten by an infected creature, or for every hour spent in an area of high radiationâthe creature must succeed on a DC 11 a Constitution saving throw or contract the radiation disease.
>
> It takes 1d4 days for the disease to manifest. As it does the creature's skin gains a sickly green tint and abscesses start to spread across its surface. At the end of that period, the creature gains advantage on saving throws against poison and gains resistance against poison damage. The creature also has disadvantage on all Strength and Dexterity ability checks, and weapon attack rolls.
>
> Creatures who have carried the radiation disease for more than two weeks have their skin turn entirely green. The creature also no longer suffers from dis&shy;advantage on their ability checks or weapon attacks, and instead gain an indefinite madness. As described in the 5th Edition *Dungeon Master's Guide*.
>
> The radiation symptoms can be cured by spells such as *lesser restoration*. Once the disease has manifest, however, more powerful magic such as *greater restoration* or *heal* is required.

## Makrura
A makrura is a large aquatic race found living in small colonies along the coastlines of Azeroth and deep within the ocean. Makrura resemble enormous crayfish and observers have mistakenly called them *lobster men*.

***Aggressive and Hostile.*** A makrura within the confines of its colony is immediately hostile towards intruders and attempts to kill anyone that ventures to near. They use their massive claws to pinch their target, grappling them in place while the other tears the target into pieces.

***Wrecked Colonies.*** These large aquatic creatures create small colonies at the waterâs edge or on the ocean floor. The makrura is unable to create sable homes are often settle in the wreckages of lost ships or underwater caverns.

***Savory Prey.*** The meat of a makrura has proven to be a  tasty treat to many races, and is appreciated all too well by creatures both on land and sea. Whilst some races on land hunt them for food, their most hated enemies are the ever present and notorious murlocs and nagas.

### Makrura Tidecaller
Some Makrura has an innate capacity for water magic and are able to call upon its forces, these makruras are called tidecallers. The makrura tidecallers call upon the waters to aid their allies and hamster their enemies if needed.

## Mana Wyrms
Manifesting near pockets of arcane energy, mana wyrms are small shimmering creatures that hover above the ground as they slither towards creatures or objects of arcane energy.

Rarely does the sight of a mana wyrm cause a seasoned adventurer concern, for them the small creatures are more of a nuisance than a threat and is easily avoided.

***Unstable Temperament.*** The temperament of a mana wyrm hangs solely on how long itâs been since it last fed on mana. These creatures are considered docile and harmless if fed often, but aggressive and unpredictable if hungry. The wyrms are also known for exploding in a flash of arcane.

***Arcane Sense.*** A mana wyrms can sense the taint and use of arcane energy near them and gravitate towards it, focusing their attacks against creatures that reek of arcane magic if hungry.

### Arcane Wyrm
An arcane wyrm is by many considered an overgrown mana wyrm that's been allowed to feed on too much energy before being put down. These long slithering creatures resemble large mana wyrms, and carry many of the same qualities as their kin. They are known for having a more even temperament than mana wyrms, and less prone to immediate hostility.

## Mechanicals
Mechanical constructs distinguish themselves from organic creatures mainly for their lack of blood, internal organs, and natural instincts. Instead, gears whirr and circuits spark inside these mobile machinations -- some of which act only at the behest of whoever holds the controls, while others have been configured to automatically carry out a pre-determined set of instructions.

Some mechanicals distinguish themselves further still, possessing instructions so meticulously crafted as to resemble genuine intelligence. As they are wholly driven by the logic of their configuration, mechanical constructs do not possess the ability to make an emotional response: they cannot be charmed, and they certainly cannot be frightened.

***Titanic Legacy.*** The origin of Azeroth's great mechanical achievements can be traced back to the titanic Watchers and the ordering of Azeroth. There, the titanic Keeper Mimiron oversaw the creation of a race of diminutive clockwork humanoids; mechagnomes, forerunners of the gnomes who now stand on the contested frontier of technological innovation.

***Gnomish and Goblin Ingenuity.*** Alongside the legacy of the gnomes, carrying on the work of the titanic Keeper who saw their creation, another source of technolgical innova&shy;tion on Azeroth has been the artifically enhanced ingenuity of the goblins. Unlike the gnomes, however, such goblin ingenuity has a tendency to be remarkably destructive. The two races have led a contested field of engineering, and have overseen countless mechanical wonders and mishaps across several decades -- including cities, transportation systems, explosive automatons, and giant death rays.

### Mechanical Animal Template
A mechanical animal is any Huge or smaller beast created by gnomes and engineers to resemble the shape of a beast found on Azeroth. The following characteristics change or are added to a mechanical animal when created.

***Retained Characteristics.*** The mechanical animal retains its Armor Class, hit points, Hit Dice, Speed, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, vulnerabilities, resis&shy;tances, immunities, and special traits.

***Lost Characteristics.*** The mechanical animal loses its original saving throw and skill bonuses, and special sense. It loses any action that isn't Multiattack or a melee weapon attack that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. If it has an action or a melee weapon attack that deals some other type of damage, it loses the ability to deal damage of that type, unless the damage comes from a piece of equipment, such as a magic item.

***Type.*** The mechanical animal's type is construct, and it loses any tags it might have had.

***Alignment.*** The mechanical animal is unaligned.

***Ability Scores.*** The mechanical animal's ability scores change as follows: Int 3 (-4), Wis 11 (+0), Cha 1 (-5).

***Senses.*** The mechanical animal has 60 feet darkvision.

***Condition Immunities.*** The mechanical animal can't be charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, or gain exhaustion levels.

***Languages.*** The mechanical animal loses all languages it might've known, and understand the languages of its creator, but can't speak.

#### Sample Mechanical Animal
As an example, the Mechanostrider shown here uses the base statistics of a tallstrider.

### Alarm-o-Bot
These constructs are, as the name suggests, walking alarms. Originally by gnomes as a safeguard, to protect themselves against enemies hidding away in the dark, rugged terrain of their homelands, the alarm-o-bot keeps a constant watch for any sound or motion that it can discern with its numerous sensors. If it detects anything it cannot confirm as friendly, it blares out a high-pitched warning.

### Bombling
One of the original pinnacles of goblin engineering, bomb&shy;lings -- or bomb bots -- is a bomb affixed with a set of legs and a pair of eyes. Once a bombling has fixed itself onto a target, it gives chase until it gets close enough to detonate.

### Crowd Pummeler
A mechanical design adopted by both goblins and gnomes, crowd pummelers take the form of a tall bipedal construct loaded with heavy weaponry. Its name is not coincidental, as it is most commonly used as cheap, easily maintained sentries; programmable with a set of laws and regulations, and equipped with the chief directive to pummel anyone found to break said laws.

### Mechano-Tank
The Mechano-tank, or spider tank, is a gnomish construct best known for its armoured chassis and spider-like design. Built for close-quarters conflicts, most mechano-tanks come armed with fine-tuned and deadly weaponry. Their legs are able to contract and release, launching the tank forward into combat.

Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed saving throw, the target is knocked prone.

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

> ##### Variant: Arcane Nullifier
> An arcane nullifier has a challenge rating of 4 (1,100 XP). It has the same statistics as a crowd pummeler except that it replaces the pummeler's action options with the following action options.
> <div style='margin-top:5px;'></div>
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Multiattack.*** The nullifier makes two claw attacks.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
>
> ***Slow (Recharge 5-6).*** The nullifier targets one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The creature must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The effect lasts for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
>
> ***Nullify (Recharge after a Long Rest).*** The nullifier attempts to dispel all magical effects within 30 feet of it, as if it had cast the *dispel magic* as a 3rd-level spell on everything within range.
> <div style='margin-top:5px;'></div>
>
> The nullifier also gains the following reaction.
> <div style='margin-top:5px;'></div>
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Reflection Field.*** When a creature hits the nullifier with a ranged spell attack, the nullifier can reflect the spell onto a target within 15 feet of it.

> ##### Crewing a Mechano-tank
> Most mechano-tanks are manual machines that require a pilot to operate, and even autopiloted tanks can be overwritten to work manually for a time.
>
> A creature can use its action to attempt to climb a **piloted** mechano-tank by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failed save, the creature expends half its movement and is unable to climb the mechano-tank.
>
> The controls of the mechano-tank is sealed tight behind a hatch. The hatch can be opened with a successful DC 20 Strength check, or broken if dealt 20 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, it has an Armor Class (AC 15).
>
> A Small or smaller creature can expend 5 feet of movement to enter an unoccupied mechano-tank. A creature unfamiliar with the controls of tank must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence check to under&shy;stand the controls of the machine before it is able to pilot it and control its actions and movement.
>
> While piloted, the mechano-tanks Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are exchanged with those of the pilot. A piloted tank uses the initiative of its pilot. The pilot must use its action, reaction, and movement to use the machines action options or force it to move to a new location. While a crea&shy;ture is crewing the mechano-tank, it is considered to have full cover against any attack made against it from the ground.
>
> Taking control of an **autopiloted** tank requires a successful DC 17 Tinker's Tool Intelligence check. On a successful save, the creature takes control of the tank until the end of the creature's next turn. At which point the shredderâs failsafe mechanisms return, requiring a new save to temporarily take control of it.

## Murloc
From a distance the degenerated fishlike humanoids that is murlocs might not seem like a big threat, but the small creatures are never alone and never far from their tribe and the water they inhabit. Their disgraceful and often humorous nature should not be underestimated cause behind their blank expressions lies a murderous mindset.

***Strange Territories.*** Murlocs populate coastlines, lake&shy;shores and swamps, never straying far from the land of their tribe. In more recent times, they have spread to many regions across Azeroth, inhabiting inland lakes and long secluded beaches.

Murlocs build strange chaotic villages of mud-and-twig huts that resemble structures more suited for the bed of the ocean than above the water. Their huts are scattered chaotically about without a discernible pattern, except for the prominent hut distinctly crafted for their oracle.

***Questionable Intelligence.*** Many races suggest that the murlocs are not particularly clever, considering their nearly impossible to decipher language. Others argue that, their ability to use weapons and their unusual fighting skills indicate a devilish smartness.

Murlocs are faithful creatures with a faith unlike any other. They worship entities of the sea, from the ordinary fish to huge elementals, and even prominent nagas. But their faith and belief in an entity is usually temporary and can change over the span of a week as events change.

***Pack Fighters.*** Even though murlocs aren't particularly brave, they will attack any traveler that approaches them if they can outnumber them.

Under pressure they flee to the water hoping for their foe to be foolish enough to follow them. Those who chase them underwater, regrets it as soon as they realize that there are several murlocs waiting in hiding, ready to attack quickly from all directions, like a swarm of hungry fish.

### Murloc Tidehunter
While many murlocs can use their intelligence to handle weapons to defend themselves, some of them are able to use their equipment to hunt. Being able to create nets and use them, tidehunters attacking in numbers, can be a serious threat to anyone foolish enough to pass through their territory. 

### Murloc Oracle
Even though most murlocs are raised to be warriors and hunters, few of them are born with a heightened willpower. Those murlocs, called oracles, are natural spellcasters. They are masters of the elements and can use them to control the environment around their enemies.

### Murloc Names and Language
Murlocs speak the Nerglish tongue, a strange language only spoken by aquatic creatures. Nerglish is a low aquatic language similar to Low Common and only spoken by a handful of lesser races.

Their names contain many wet, *soft* sounds; sh, i, and m are common amongst their names. Murlocs do not have individual surnames, instead they take the name of their tribe. Tribal names recall something of the tribe's accom&shy;plishments, appearance, history, or tradition.

## Nagas
The naga are former Highborne night elves who mutated into vengeful humanoid sea serpents. While many remain on Azeroth to attempt to reclaim the surface world, a large group followed Illidan Stormrage into Outland and proceeded to claim the watery areas of the shattered land.

***Mystical Culture.*** Naga culture is quite complex. Male naga are larger and more muscular, most of them serving as soldiers and guardians. 

Female naga are more delicate, with smaller scales and finer, more human-like faces. Naga women are natural spellcasters and rely on magic to defeat their enemies. Even though naga men are more numerous, the naga consider their women to be magically and intellectually superior. Their society is matriarchal, with women occupying most positions of leadership, and all naga paying homage to their queen, Azshara. 

***Altered Appearance.*** During the Great Sundering, Azshara and many of her Highborne followers fell into the depths of the Great Sea. Unable to avoid her death, Azshara forged a pact with an Old God, N'Zoth, trans&shy;forming her and her followers into the serpentine naga.

The naga are part night elf, part serpent, and some have evolved oceanic mutations. In all naga, many of these mutations are simply cosmetic â soft spines running down their backs, or extra fins adorning their arms. Some naga, though, also possess mutations that have a more substantial effect. 

***Azshara's Followers.*** All naga revere their queen, the mighty Azshara. They have never had another queen, and Azshara has become a living demigod for the naga. They do everything according to her design. 

Factions work continuously in bids for power, seeking the blessings of their queen. The vast majority of Azshara's servitors are willing to go to any means to elevate them&shy;selves in her eyes, even at the cost of their own lives.

### Naga Myrmidon
The myrmidons, with their navy blue skin and fearsome tridents, are among the strongest warriors in the naga's huge army. They are feared by all who dwell near the sea, most especially by the Makrura Empire.

Among their people, they are the most fanatically loyal to their beloved queen so much so that they no longer bother acknowledging orders, they simply do them.

### Naga Sea Witch
"Sea witch" is the informal term for a naga priestess of the tides. These scaly denizens of the ocean have often been associated with the coming of prodigious storms, but few have actually seen them rise from the sea and lived to tell the tale.

They are potent spellcasters, able to use terrifying frost and lightning spells against their foes. They also draw upon their race's arcane legacy to protect themselves.

### Naga War Lord
Naga war lords are male naga warriors with stony arms  and shells fused to their skin. They have no visible eyes, and a large hermit crab for a hand. This may be resultant of their mutations, or they may be a different subspecies altogether.

### Naga Brute
Naga brutes are huge, mutated naga used as heavy fighters and even as siege weapons by the naga army. Some have rank, while some act more like mere beasts.

## Ogres
Ogres are large, brutish humanoids of immense strength native to the crumbling world of Draenor, many ogres have now settled as independent clans on Azeroth. The average adult specimen stands between 9 and 10 feet tall and weighs close to a thousand pounds.

Ogres believe the most important physical attribute is size and eschew garments that cover too much skin. Many instead adorn their skin with fearsome warpaints.

***Distant Settlements.*** After the Horde's second defeated attempt at invading Azeroth, the ogre clans of Draenor dispersed in all directions to establish dominance of their own in this new world. Few returned to Draenor, and many made the difficult journey across the great sea to Kalimdor. 

Ogres have settled throughout all of Azeroth and can be found in the furthest corners of the world.

***Clan Culture.*** Ogres have long since lived in large clans in which physical strength is greatly respected, and besting a rival is usually the only way to advance within the clan. 

Even though physical strength is seen as being the <br> most important attribute in their societies, the <br> powerful and keen minded ogre magi's often <br> enjoy an elevated position within a clan <br> due to their magical abilities.

***Brutish Combatants.*** The low intelligence <br> of most ogres push them towards simple and <br> straight forward solutions when they engage in <br> combat, often suffering as much punishment as <br> they dish out, relying on their strength and <br> stamina to keep them victorious at the battles end.

They are vicious opponents with the strength to rip off an opponentâs limbs should they so choose. Most favor heavy spiked clubs and mauls capable of bashing in the skull of their target and bring down heavy the heavy prey they hunt.

### Ogre Magi
An ogre magi is an ogre with an intelligence unlike that of most of its kin. Many ogre magi is the product of magic itself and came into existence during the Horde's second invasion of Azeroth, these hulking ogres sprouted a second head rumored to be the source of their keen mind and affinity for arcane magic. Although most ogre magi's have two heads, individual ogres have proven capable of making the incantations required to cast spells like those of a Magi.

### Ogre Lord
Ogre lords are hulking ogres that towers above the heads of regular ogres, these hulking monsters have no unique powers or special affinity towards arcana, but a strength and size without equal in the clan that has made them able to best rivals and always come out victorious. These ogres are able to wield clubs the size of tree-trunks and bash them against their enemies with an unmatched fury.

## Owlbeasts
An owlbeast is a serene and powerful creature <br>that inhabits forested regions of the world. They <br>resemble a cross between a bear and an owl, and <br>with the antlers of a great stag. Its strong claws and <br>hooked beak suggest a violent being, but its large golden eyes show its gentle nature.

***Forest Settlers.*** Owlbeasts live within the depths of forested regions, finding shelter in rocky terrain and uninhabited caverns. Owlbeasts are social creatures and live in small colonies within themselves. With no apparent structure of leadership, they live a harmonious lifestyle.

***Peaceful Creatures.*** Most owlbeasts treat peaceful travelers with as much respect as they are shown, occasio&shy;nally coming to their aid or assisting lost visitors by showing them safe roads out of their forests. Although owlbeasts are respectful of others who wander the forests, they show extreme ferocity against those who do not heed their gentle declines or openly show them hostility.

***Elune's Creation.*** Night elves and druids alike claim that the goddess Elune created the first owlbeasts in the early days of the world to serve as guardians to Cenarius. Combi&shy;ning the best traits of the owl, the most beloved of her night birds, and the bear, the lumbering protector of the woods. Resulting in the swift, elegant, and fiercely loyal hunters

But through the ages, the owlbeasts have grown more feral in their nature, and without the guidance of the goddess many are confused. They wander without purpose, though some find their way back to the sacred areas that they once swore to protect.

***Corruptible Minds.*** Owlbeasts are by nature peaceful and calm, but they are not the strongest mental creatures on Azeroth, and their minds have shown to be easily corrupted by greater powers, turning the calm owlbeasts into ferocious and easily aggravated beasts that can turn against visitors at a momentâs notice.

### Owlbeast
Owlbeasts are considered much more feral than the calm and peaceful moonkin, these creatures are more prone to be aggravated and go into an enraged stage where no sense can be made with them. They settle in large packs wherever they find shelter, even if it brings them into close contact with more sentient race, forcing them to fight for their home or find somewhere else.

### Moonkin
The mighty moonkin are claimed to be Elune's creation, these creatures appear similar to a simply owlbeast when first encountered, and could easily be mistaken for such. While owlbeasts trespass the border into feral beasts. A moonkin is a sentient creature capable of rational thinking and coherent conversation. Moonkin are blessed by Elune to spread nature's grace wherever they settle, and when threatened they exert the full force of the moon goddess.

## Quilboars
A ferocious, suicidally brave race with an alien mentality and devotion to their tribe, quilboars are stubby hunched humanoids with a pig-like face and rows of sharp spines running down its muscular back.

Quilboars have worn down brown skin adorned with tribal markings and tattoos, long razer-sharp quills runs the length of their back in place of hair. Multiple sets of stubby tusks protrude from the side of their mouth.

***Sacred Settlements.*** Quilboars live in the shade and protection of enormous roots that mar the land and choke out other life, turning the earth around them barren. The quilboar tribes flock to the thorny areas of central Kalimdor believe the regions to be sacred, and the erupted roots to have grown from the blood of Agamaggan.

When quilboars have turned a land too barren for them to settle in, their tribe moves on to find new areas to hunt in and their mighty thornweavers seed and grow new roots for them to live in.

***Hostile Colonies.*** These pig-like humanoids live in large colonies within their sacred thorn settlements. They are fiercely loyal to their colony, and defend it with reckless ferocity when nearby denizens venture too close to the thorns that mark their territories.

***Crude Shamanism.*** Quilboars practice a crude form of shamanism, weaving its forces together with druidic magic to make their mighty thornweavers. These shamans are kept in high regard by their colonies, and are seen as the voice of Agamaggan.

Quilboars revere the ancient Agamaggan as their creator and deity. Calling upon his aid to bolster them in fights and making sacrifices in his name. His blood would grow the twisted thorns of Razorfen, and his remain would adorn its entrance. All quilboars consider it to be a sacred place without equal on this earth.
### Quilboar Packmaster
Quilboars have a natural affinity towards boars, and some amongst them have made it their lives worth to raise and fight alongside such creatures. These packmasters are rarely alone, taking in the company of one or more boars wherever they go.

### Quilboar Thornweaver
The wise thornweavers are core to most quilboar colonies, these shamans are the voice of Agamaggan within a colony and their word is respected by all, and they are often close advisors of a colony's chieftain. In some colonies, the word of a thornweaver is placed above that of its chieftain and on rare occasions a thornweaver replaces a chieftain.

### Quilboar Chieftain
A quilboar chieftain rules over each colony, in most cases a quilboar became chieftain by overthrowing the colony's previous leader. They are surrounded by wise thornweavers and under rare circumstances a chieftain has one or more battleguards under their command. These brutish quil&shy;boars are the honor guards of a chieftain, and oversee the colony in the chieftains absence.

## Ravagers
Native to the world of Draenor, these quadrupedal beings roam the land surrounding them in search of food to fill their insatiable appetite, willing to dig their ragged teeth into any creature made of flesh.

Ravagers resemble giant insectiods equipped with ragged teeth and a carnivorous lust for meat. Their bodies are covered in hard chitin, combined with their surprising speed they make able fighters.

***Voracious Carnivores.*** Ravagers are able predators who hide behind rocks and in crevices until their quarry's within reach, only to emerge in great numbers and swarm around their prey to eliminate any possible escape. They ravage the land around them, extinguishing all potential life as they hunt for their colony's survival.

***Swarm Mentality.*** These large insectoids live in ever-growing colonies with the mentality of a large swarm.  They move as one, never leaving anyone behind and wander the land in search for food to survive. Although ravagers do not have an innate link like that of silithids, but they seem to be capable of predicting each others ideas and movements, mimicking them with immense precision.

***Migrated Creatures.*** Ravagers are native to the world of Draenor and have no equivalent on Azeroth. Yet they have found their way onto its surface through the crashed ship, Exodar. Stowaway beings on the ship, they had previously been captured and imprisoned, but the crashing of the ship allowed them to escape onto the shimmer isles west of kalimdors coast.

### Ravager Brood Mother
At the heart of a ravager colony sits the brood mother, she grants the colony life by laying the eggs that hatches into small ravager larva, blostering the colony's numbers. The brood mother is the queen of the colony and her survival means the survival of the colony as a whole, ravagers will go to extreme lengths to secure her safety.

### Ravager Wasp
Ravagers hatch as small insignificant larva that are quick to disappear into pupae, only to emerge as slender wasps with a swarm mentality and a ferocious sting. Wasps gorge themselves until their wings can no longer support their body weight, after which they undergo a third and final metamorphosis into the vicious four-legged ravagers.

> ##### Ravagers on alternate Draenor
> The ravagers of alternate Draenor were never exposed to the powers of fel, their bodies were not malformed. These creatures have evolved into large monsters more resembling four-legged spiders, their wings have grown with them giving all ravagers a flying speed equal to their normal speed.

## Sabercats
Sabercats are cunning felines that prowl across <br> Azeroth in their hunt for prey. These large proud, and magnificent felines have become a companion of many adventurers, and the demise of even more. <br> They are intelligent and loyal when domesticated, <br> but feral and quite aggressive when left in their <br> natural environments.

***Stalkers of Azeroth.*** Sabercats are found in many regions of Azeroth, but the vast majority of their kind can be found upon Kalimdor. The feline creatures have each adjusted to their various climate, sprouting pelts to help them blend in, and adapting to their surroundings. 

Many species of sabercats exist, each having adapted <br> to their climate differently and act differently towards outsiders, the most common sabercats are: Dreadsabers, Frostsabers, and Nightsabers, as well as the magically enhanced Manasaber of Suramar.

***Supreme Predators.*** Sabercats are deadly hunters and display the pinnacle prowess when allowed. They are able to prowl up upon unaware prey with ease, even displaying great athletic and acrobatic capabilities if needed.

***Fierce Companion.*** Night elves have bred and trained sabercats as mounts and companions for war through the ages, the trained sabercats are always exclusively night&shy;sabers but exceptions have been made. Once domesticated or fully trained from a cub, these beasts are loyal to a fault and make for a life-long companion.

### Manasaber
A manasaber is a magically infused sabercat, these beasts have been locked away with the decaying Highborne of Suramar for thousands of years, slowly mutation through generations into creatures infused with arcane energy. Manasabers take the appearance of slender sabercats with magical runes of power dimly glowing across their pelt.

Most manasabers are domesticated having been trapped in close proximity with night elves for thousands of years, but feral manasabers still exist.

<br>

> ##### Variant: Sabercat Armor
> An armored sabercat has an AC based on the type of barding worn (see the *Player's Handbook* for more information on barding). The sabercat's AC includes its Dexterity modifier, where applicable. Barding doesn't alter the sabercat's challenge rating.

## Satyrs
An ancient curse afflicted a Highborne sorcerer, destroying and remaking him as the very first satyr. These demonic beings were once night elves of the kaldorei empire, but little of that heritage is left in the demonic bodies of the satyrs and now these creatures carry a hatred towards all.

***Cursed Affliction.*** During the War of the Ancients, the Highborne sorcerer Xavius was tasked with opening the portal that connect the Twisting Nether and Azeroth, a task he failed in accomplishing and his disembodied spirit tortured as punishment by Sargaras. Yet the creator of the Burning Legion saw use in Xavius still and created him a new body, the first satyr in existence.

Xavius was sent back to Azeroth to spread his cursed existence to the Kaldorei Empire, twisting and reshaping night elves into the demonic satyr race. Like Xavius, all satyrs have the ability to pass on their curse and the curse have continued to spread through the ages, although the curse has weakened over time and become less effective.

***A Burning Hatred.*** Satyrs are creatures of hatred; they were created out of hate and carry on that quality from their creator. Satyrs have a burning hatred for all other living creatures and especially their night elven kin. They are immediately hostile towards outsiders and attempts to manipulate or corrupt them if possible.

***Tainted Magic.*** These demonic creatures corrupt the land they walk on and drain its magic as if they were wielding the powers of fel directly. They feed off its purity, leeching and corrupting. The magic they drain is stored in their hooves; the satyr that has drawn the most magic are distinguished by their swollen, uncloven hooves.

***Frightful Fighters.*** Satyrs are not known for being an organized enemy with a strategy for battle. They live in smaller sects found in more remote regions of Azeroth. When the sentry sounds danger, every satyr in the sect is quick to throw themselves into battle without worrying for their own lives. They act like a horde of demons without a commander whose orders to follow. 

### Satyr Trickster
Some satyrs show a certain penchant for painful traps and ambushing their target, these satyrs are called tricksters. They revere and mimic their Lord, Xavius' abilities of manipulation, and take a more subtle approach when the horn of battle is sound, sneaking up on their enemies and stabbing them in the back in an attempt to take out the strongest target of the assault.

### Satyr Hellcaller
A satyr hellcaller is a spellcaster skilled in fielding the chaotic fel of the Burning Legion. Rather than summoning demons of the Legion, these warlocks manipulate the entropic fire of fel itself. They are larger and more imposing than a common satyr because of magic they have drained from the land.

## Scourge
Free of the demonic masters that created them, the precursor of the Burning Legions invasion into Azeroth have gained a will of their own. Under the rule of the dread Lich King the Scourge have built up their power on the arctic continent of Northrend, spreading their influence throughout the continent and beyond to the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor.

Terrifying and destructive, the Scourge consists of <br> creatures resurrected into undeath by necromancers devoted to the Lich King, twisting their forms into undead abominations raised for their dark lord's service. From the icy realm of Northrend the Lich King rules uncontested, unleashing his undead minions on the world.

***The Lich King.*** In an attempt to escape a shattering Draenor, the old shaman Ner'zhul was apprehended by <br> the demon lord Kil'jaeden. He tore the shaman's body <br> apart, but kept his spirit intact and aware. Kil'jaeden <br> offered Ner'zhul his last chance to serve the Burning <br> Legion. The old orc agreed, his spirit was trapped within <br> a block of ice warped by the demon lord's chatoc powers.

Encased in a block of ice the Lich King was sent to Azeroth, landing in the frozen wastelands of North- <br> rend. Here, the spectral being of unfathomable power would begin the formation of the Undead Scourge. From his frozen throne of Northrend, the Lich King extended his will across the land to form his Undead Scourge, ever mindful of Kil'jaedens schemes as he in secret sought a way out of his icy prison.

In his search for a way out of his prison, the Lich Kings attention was eventually drawn to the prince of Lordaeron, Arthas Menethil. A capable warrior who had taken up arms against the seemingly endless assaults of his Scourge. Arthas grew increasingly restless as he pushed back against the Scourge, eventually tracking the origin of its plague to Northrend. Intend on ending its threat forever he took up the cursed runeblade Frostmourne. Thought the sword did grant him great power, the cost was high as Arthas began to lose his soul. Eventually completing <br> unholy transformation as his soul slipped away. He <br> became Ner'zhuls champion and would be a fearful <br> warrior leading the Scourge through its rampage at the <br> Lich Kings command. 

After countless battles, the demise of great and powerful individuals, leaders of kingdoms and commanders of the Burning Legion. Arthas would travel to Northrend and enter the hollow glacier that had become the Lich kings throne. With a cry of strength, Arthas would strike through the Lick Kings prison. As he placed Ner'zhuls thorny helm on his head, their spirits would fuse into a single mighty being, just as the Lich King had always planned. And thus one of the most powerful entities on Azeroth was born.

***Plague of Undeath.*** Ner'zhul needed to create an army, a vanguard for the Burning Legions invasion. For that he conjured the plague of undeath, a magical affliction that would spread across Lordaeron as a disease. Killing the afflicted and causing them to rise once more under Ner'zhuls influence. The plague was aimed at the human as of regions, but it afflicted much more than that, infecting flora and fauna and giving them strange symptoms of the plague itself, but rarely imminent death.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since first conjured by Ner'zhul the plague has lingered in regions of Lordaeron, creating the plaguelands them&shy;selves. In the years following its use, others have attempted to use the plague of undeath as a weapon for their own benefit, some have tried to recreate its effects themselves.

***The Frozen Throne.*** The Icecrown Citadel dominates Northrend, visible from farther away than nearly any other structure and the home to the greatest army of undead in the known world. atop its glacial core sits dwells the Lich King, emitting his will across Azeroth to the commanders of the Scourge under his influence.

### Abomination
Twisted, mutilated creatures comprised of multiple dead limbs and body parts from different corpses. Abominations are not risen like so many other undead, they a created. Constructed out of putrid flesh, loosely stitched together to create enormous masses of rotting flesh. 

They are fearsome creatures that takes joy in carving the flesh from the bones of their quarry and lustfully eating it as if it was a delightful meal.

### Gargoyle
Unlike most creatures of the Undead Scourge, Gargoyles are not undead. These strange, wiry flyers are known for their rough, crystaline hides that protects them from all manner of attacks.

Stemming from the frozen northrend, gargoyles were brought to Lordaeron at Arthas' command as scouts in the army of the Scourge. Chaotic by nature, they have proven effective in their task and a frightful aerial combatant.

### Ghoul
Ravenous cannibals that leave only havoc and devoured corpses behind them. Ghouls are lumbering creatures of once innocent humans transformed into rotting corpses with a lust for flesh and terror.

They are a weapon of panic for the Scourge, a mindless vanguard made to terrorize settlements before the forces of the Scourge arrives. Made for the sole purpose of striking terror and doubt in settlements as they feast on the dead and living, friend and foe alike.

## Shredder
Large and impressive mechanical constructs, a shredder is a marvel of goblin ingenuity designed to replace lumber&shy;jacks and increase the profits of deforesting. These metal machines are often piloted by a creature crewed in its seat.

Shredders have made their way across Azeroth and can be found in the furthest of its corners where they work under the watchful eyes of goblin foremen as they harvest lumber, deforesting entire regions for their nefarious profit.

***Enemies of the Forest.*** Shredders are machines used to quickly and efficiently deforest entire regions, and because of this they have garnered a reputation and hatred amongst the creatures of the forest. 

Although the large shredders are mostly used for manual labor and harvesting, they often encounter resistance from creatures of the forest and are forced into fending them off. With their solid metal construction and great saw blades the machines have become great constructs of war, a fact their pilots makes good use of.

> ##### Crewing a Shredder
> Most shredders are manual machines that require a pilot to operate, and even autopiloted shredders can be overwritten to work manually for a time.
>
> A creature can use its action to attempt to climb a **piloted** shredder by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failed save, the creature expends half its movement and is unable to climb the shredder.
>
> A Medium or smaller creature can expend 5 feet of movement to enter an unoccupied shredder. A creature unfamiliar with the controls of shredders must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence check to understand the controls of the machine before it is able to pilot it and control its actions and movement.
>
> While piloted, the shredders Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are exchanged with those of the pilot. A piloted shredder uses the initiative of its pilot. The pilot must use its action, reaction, and movement to use the machines action options or force it to move to a new location. While a creature is crewing the shredder, it is considered to have three-quarters cover against any attack made against it from the ground.
>
> Taking control of an **autopiloted** shredder requires a successful DC 14 Tinker's Tool Intelligence check. On a successful save, the creature takes control of the shredder until the end of the creature's next turn. At which point the shredderâs  failsafe mechanisms return, requiring a new save to temporarily take control of it.

## Silithids
Silithids are frightful insectoids living in large colonies beneath the crust of Azeroth. Although their individual strength is questionable at best, their collective hive mind is able to send warnings and pain surging through the hive.

Silithid can range drastically in size, beginning their life as small insignificant larva and growing into the swarms of insectoids that make up their race. Whatever their size may be, they all resemble massive insects. If those insects had mutated and desperately wanted to kill you.

***Spawns of Qiraji.*** As the kingdon of the aqir was left in ruins, those who remained would split in two and venture in opposite directions. One grouped traveled as far south as south goes and ransacked the research station near Uldum. Converting the titan facility into an extensive hive, renamed themselves the qiraji and their new home Ahn'Qiraj.

But their new hive held a dark secret, the facility had served as the prison of C'Thun, one of the Old Gods who had once reigned over primordial Azeroth. The arrival of the qiraji turned the facility from a prison into a seat of power. Worshiping the Old God as the aqirs had before them, the qiraji would become his servants and spent thousands of years building an army capable of exacting revenge upon the whole of Kalimdor.

To form this army C'Thun would create the silithid, a race of insectiod creatures born from the qiraji themselves. The silithid would grow and become an enormous force for Ahn'Qiraj to utilize as they  created their great empire.

***Bestial Drones.*** Unlike the qiraji, the silithid are not intelligent, sentient beings. C'Thun created them from the powers of the qiraji to become a mighty force for Ahn'Qiraj. Mindless bestial insectoids, minions that are eternally loyal to the qiraji and in turn C'Thun himself.

<div style='margin-top:733px;'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Collective Hive Mind.*** Although silithids might seem to be acting of their own accord, they are not sentient beings and work as a collective entity in their hive. This does not though make them any less dangerous. A hive of silithids is often controlled by one or more colossi exerting their will over the collective hive and directing their way of life.

The hive colossi's are in turn controlled by the powerful qiraji who exert complete dominance over the race shaped from their own beings. It is not uncommon for large hives to have a large crystalline prism deep within its core for the qiraji to communicate various messages through.

***Adaptable Hive.*** No other creature can adapt to changes in their environment as quickly as the silithid. Although adventurers foolish enough to delve into the hive of silithids in hopes of removing their colossi might think that killing the center of the hive mind will hamper the silithids. The larva can evolve into a variety of silithid creatures based on the needs of the hive and replenish any loss.

## Skeletons
Skeletons arise when animated by dark magic. They heed the summons of necromancers who call them from their stony tombs and ancient battlefields, or rise of their own accord in places saturated with death and loss, awakened by stirrings of necromancy or presence of corrupting evil.

***Animated Dead.*** Whatever sinister force awakens a skeleton infuses its bones with a dark vitality, adhering joint to joint and reassembling limbs. This energy motivates <br>a skeleton to move and think in a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. Resurrecting a skeleton restores its body and soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empowers it.

While most skeletons are the animated remains of dead humans and other humanoids, skeletal undead can be created from the bones of other creatures besides human&shy;oids, giving rise to a host of terrifying and unique forms.

***Obedient Servants.*** Skeletons raised by spell are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to the letter, never questioning the task their masters give them, regard&shy;less of the consequences. Because of their literal interpre&shy;tation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances.

A skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet. Some are even raised with knowledge of their past life and become formidable warriors or mages able to perform complex incantations.


Although most lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren't mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its way through an iron door, a skele&shy;ton tries the handle first. If that doesn't work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.

***Undead Nature.*** A skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Treant
Treants are awakened trees imbued with great wisdom and strength that dwell in ancient forests. The moving trees prefer the calm and quiet of the world's ancient forests, and little is seen of them in times of peace and calm.

***Ancient Sapling.*** Treants are powerful, ancient trees and a more primitive form of their related wise Ancients. They sprout from the seeds of the ancients and willâif they are given enough timeâgrow to be ancient protectors devoted to keeping the borders of forests safe.

***Nature's Guardians.*** These primitive ancients serve nature itself. They dwell the depths of forests and patrol its borders, flinging themselves at nature's enemies as soon as they can, slashing with their wooden claws.

Treats are closely affiliated with creatures of the forests and powerful druids and often accompany such creatures through their forests. The treants are also known to act as guide for allies of nature, showing them safe passage through the heart of the forest.

***Corrupted and Insane.*** The destruction of Azeroth's forests during the Third War, the removal of the peaceful and beautiful homes the treants had guarded drove many of the guardians mad with grief and allowed the demonic presence to take root within and corrupt them. It has made many treants unpredictable and driven them to lash out at anyone that approaches it.

Most adventures are cautious when approaching a treant in the depths of a forest, as the ancient guardians madness won't become apparent before it's too late to retreat.

## Troggs
Troggs are savage creatures with long, muscular arms and muscles that appear carved from stone. They grow thick, coarse beards in colors resembling chalk or granite, and it is not rare to see minerals outright growing on their flesh. Their slouched posture and burly proportions have many characterizing them as apelike troglodytes.

***Titanic origins.*** After the titanic Keepers had ended their war with the Old Gods, they set to work on shaping a new generation of titan-forged creatures within the Titan complex of Ulduar. Regrettably, their initial designs proved far too complex, yielding a race of brutish stone-skinned monstrosities -- troggs. Though the Keepers quickly went to rectify their mistakes, they could not bring themselves to destroy the defect creations. Rather, the titanic Keeper *Ironaya* saw the construction of the vault of Uldaman; a facility that would serve as a stasis chamber for the troggs, with herself as its designated warden.

Over the years, a few small groups managed to break free from Uldaman. Some of these scattered themselves out across the surface of Azeroth, while others burrowed their way deeper down to dwell in the subterranean caverns of *Deepholm*. The rest stayed as they were, asleep beneath the earth, until a dwarven excavation unearthed the titanic vault. Once the seal was broken and the troggs awoke, they quickly overpowered the dwarves and swarmed to the surface.

There, the troggs burrowed their way through every peak and valley across Khaz Modan, including the subterranean gnomish city of Gnomeregan. To this day, trogg tribes can be found in every corner of the Khaz Modan -- with distant cousins across Azeroth, above and beneath the earth.

***Progenitor race.*** Since the troggs were the initial failed experiment of the titanic Keepers, to flourish new life on Azeroth, their failure became the blueprint for future revised designs -- and ultimately, the *earthen*. A race of stone-carved beings created to help shape and order the subterranean regions of the world during the ordering of Azeroth, of which some later became the creatures since known as dwarves.

Theories have also been floated, mainly by the prominent dwarven explorer Brann Bronzebeard, that the *kobolds* are themselves an evolved offshoot from an early group of troggs. Likely one that early broke free from the titanic vault of Uldaman. There has been no conclusive evidence of this, only theories surrounding their resemblance.

***Primitive and fierce.*** Troggs are best known for their stature, ferocity, and smell -- said to resemble a mixture of mold, mange, and sour monkey. Living together in tight-knit tribes and clans, their main driving force is an imposing psyche and impressive force of will, though they are not known to be intelligent beyond being sentient. Less so than even an ogre would be considered. They follow the leadership of whoever can prove themselves the biggest and strongest, with aspiring trogg chieftains often going to great lengths to prove their viciousness. Troggs are known to eat whatever they can get their hands on; including rocks, or even occasionally other troggs.

***Underground creatures.*** With most of their existence spent underground, troggs are not fond of sunlight. Wher&shy;ever troggs dwell, a deep network of intertwining tunnels is likely to be somewhere nearby. They do most of their digging by hand, using their jagged claws, and occasionally shape weapons and other tools out of the rocks they excavate. Like the troggs themselves, a trogg dwelling is ill-reputed for is repulsive smell.

### Trogg Names and Language
Troggs do not possess any discernible language of their own, and tend to resort to violence rather than negotiation when faced with a threat. Still, those who do communicate do so in a mixture of grunts and what Common they know.

Their names draw from the same roots as dwarven language, especially with its hard consonants and guttural sounds. Some troggs, usually tribe leaders, choose names in Common to best describe themselves. It is unclear whether these names are direct translations, or deliberate choices to intimidate other races.

Trogg tribes are usually in Common, and often draw from their way of being or directly from whichever place they claim as their home.

<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

**Trogg Names:** Argh, Agrok, Bruggor, Gorgash, Grimlok,
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morloch, Murdaloc, Raggosh, Revelosh

## Trolls
Over ten thousand years ago, the trolls were divided and scattered across the face of Azeroth, as they established a new identity for themselves and became one of the most diverse races on the planet. They were one of the first native races of the world and all descendant of their mighty forefathers; the Zandalari.

***Tribal Preference.*** The trolls have always been a tribal race that isolated themselves and settled in the land to start anew. Many trolls believe that they owe no loyalty towards anyone but those of their own tribe. The tribe is their family and trolls will go to extreme lengths to protect their home.

***Racial Differences.*** Trolls as a race are amongst the most separated, their ancient divide has turned each troll tribe into a race of their own with customs unlike that of other tribes. They have settled across the face of the world and had to adapt to their harsh environment.

Racial tension between troll tribes have always been there but they tribes are only gathered when called upon by their Zandalari forefathers and under such occasions their discomfort is of little importance.

***Outside Hostility.*** Trolls are very isolated beings <br> that settle in remote regions where they can be <br> left alone and be out of reach from other <br> races of the world. But they are also very territorial and will retaliate with fierce force and numbers if their borders are threatened. Because of their isolation few trolls speak the common tongue or any of the languages of the races that have settled themselves around them.

***Loa's Guidance.*** Trolls carry a deep devotion towards dark spirits and primal, animalistic gods known as Loa. Countless Loa exist, most are weak, shapeless spirits that only the trolls can sense, whereas others have animal form. Troll societies make up Loa of their own, families worship a family Loa, cities might have their own civic deities, and great loas are worshipped by nations as a whole.

***Regeneration.*** Smashing a troll's bones and slashing through its rubbery hide only makes them angry. A troll's wounds close at extraordinary speed. Only through acid or fire can a creature arrest their regenerative properties. Although their natural regeneration is only capable of healing so much and once the heart pumps its last there's no way for it to retaliate.

### Troll Headhunter
A troll headhunter is specialized in tracking pray and tossing their spear from great distances. These trolls are able trackers and formidable hunters who take on trophies of their fallen opponents in the form of fingers, ears, or other body part that is easily cut off to show off their prowess to the tribe and strike fear in the enemies.

### Troll Berserker
Strength have always been an important part of a tribeâs survival, they need to be stronger than their enemy to survive. To a troll berserker, strength is everything. These brutish trolls toss their weapons at their enemies as they call out a war cry and sprint into the fray, recklessly swinging their axes around without a care.

### Troll Witch Doctor
A troll witch doctor is seen as the spiritual leader of a tribe and a close advisor of its leader. It is to the witch doctor that a tribe looks for spiritual answers or as a speaker of the loas. These cunning and intelligent trolls are capable magic users and use it vividly in their practice of voodoo.

They are also known for being dastardly alchemists who knows no limits when it comes to creating magical concoctions or fumes that will bolster ones physique or give visions of something that may, or may not, be true.

### Dire Troll
Dire trolls are strikingly large trolls that tower above the heads of their brethren. These trolls use their immense strength to toss boulders, or enemies, across the battlefield. There is not definitive say behind their size and strength. Some are elevated through alchemical or magical means, while others may simply have evolved beyond the rest of their tribe. Whatever the case might be, dire trolls are seen as proud and honorable creatures amongst trolls.

## Thunder Lizard
Few scouts who spot a Thunder Lizard in close proximity are stupid, or brave, enough to engage the beast in an open skirmish. The thick-skinned thunder lizard bears a striking resemblance to a kodo, and many have speculated that the beasts are related in one way or another. 

But that is also where the similarities between the beasts ends, this monstrous kodo is extremely aggressive and persistent when provoked, and wonât hesitate to exhale a streak of lightning towards its challenger.

***Creatures of Myth.*** A thunder lizard is considered a mystical creature by many and are a rare sight, only made rarer by their aggressive nature putting an end to those who don't take appropriate precautions before attempting to get a closer look.

The mighty tauren think of thunder lizards as creatures of legend, believing that the spirits of kodos can be bound by the sky and storm, creating the thundering monsters.

***Grassland Scavengers.*** Thunder lizards roam the vast grasslands and plains of Kalimdor in search of prey to consume. Thunder lizards are carnivorous creatures and will eat the entirety of their prey, dissolving their body and everything they might've carried with them in its stomach.

In their great hunt for prey, denizens have noticed that the great thunder lizards avoid other kodos they encounter, leaving them unharmed as it ventures through.

***Lone Wanderers.*** Thunder lizards are rarely found in large numbers, preferring to hunt alone or in small groups. They move across vast distances in their tireless search for food. Their wandering occasionally brings them into contact with other denizens of the plains and grasslands that they traverse, and often wander onwards leaving the area wasted as it ventures on.

## Whale Shark
Off the coasts of the continents, beneath the sunlit reaches of the Great Sea, swims the arbiter of the deep. Known to many simple as whale sharks, these legendary leviathans patrol the sunken depths, devouring any inattentive or overzealous adventurers who crosses its path.

***Devourer of All.*** These horrific leviathans swim through the sunlit oceans of Azeroth in an eternal hunt to survive. They care little for what, or who, gets swallowed into the blackness of their maw, it will provide them with nutrients in either case. They are rarely aggressive enough to directly hunt down prey to devour and more often than not swallow unfortunate creatures caught in front of its maw.

But these enormous sharks are known for having an unquenched appetite towards the whales of the Great Sea and will go to great lengths procure and eat such creatures.

***Guardians of the Deeps.*** Whale sharks are known for being territorial creatures, often swimming in great circles around its border, swallow what food may pass by. These creatures have often been found roaming the waters of ancient ruins, and it is speculated that they are safeguard&shy;ing forgotten ruins and what creatures might have taken up residence within them.

But few have been foolishi, or brave, enough to swim into the eye of their territory to unearth what forgotten world might be guarded, or attempted to stand against these monstrosities and lived to tell their tale.

## Wind Serpents
Many adventures have seen these serpentine creatures roaming the vast deserted regions of the world, slithering across its sandy surfaces or using their powerful wings to keep them drifting above its surface. The predatory snakes pays little attention to wandering adventures, as their eyes are set on a difference price, but once provoked they become a frightening enemy to fight in large numbers.

A wind serpent combines the body and head of a snake with the leathery wings of a drake, and the feathers of a brightly colored bird. Its poisonous fangs and innate ability to spew with elemental forces makes it a formidable foe.

***Spiritual Creatures.*** The winged serpents are often seen by lesser races as spirits of the sky and have become revered by tribal races such as quilboars. It is also believed that the serpents carry a connection towards the loa Hakkar the Soulflayer, granting them to name *children of hakkar* by certain individuals, and earning them a favorable place of worship by devoted individuals.

***Unseen Hunters.*** Wind serpents makes for formidable hunters. They are a predator that will ambush their prey if possible to gain the moments advantage needed for a kill. They crawl among tree branches, stalk within fissures in the earth, or fly silently out from a dark nook towards their desired prey. They attack with lightning speed, swiftly poisoning their quarry.

***Adapted Species.*** These serpentine creatures can be found in the far reaches of the world. They nest in hard-to-reach places where they can retire in safety. Many have migrated to temperate regions of the world and some to much more far off places. Different subspecies of wind serpents very drastically from one another. They adapt to the climate around them and change to better survive it.

Perceptive adventures are able to use the colorful scales of a wind serpent as a warning before engaging in an open fight. Their colors display nuances of the element force kept within, if any.

> ##### Variant: Adapted Wind Serpents
> Wind serpents are found throughout Azeroth and have adapted differently to their climate. 
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can change a wind serpent's *lightning breath* and *shocking spit* attacks to deal cold or poison damage instead of lightning by making the following changes to the attacks:
>
> ***Breath Attack.*** The breath attack becomes a cone of a size equal to half the line's length, and requires a Constitution saving throw to resist.
>
> ***Spit.*** The spit attack requires a Constitution saving throw to resist.

## Wretched
Addictive to magic, overindulging in arcane sources to the point of deformity and pushing themselves to insanity. Obsessed with obtaining and devouring magic, wretched are a danger to both themselves and others, and are usually too violent to admit surrender.

Wretched are thin elves with thinning dark hair, a large bony forehead, claw-like fingers, and strange crystalline growths on their back that gives off an eerie glow when not covered up. Most of these elves are blood elves â and occasionally high elves â unable to control their addiction to magic and falling into a crevice from which there is no escape and no turning back.

***Everpresent Pest.*** Few wretched leaves the confines of Quel'thalas, instead they scatter throughout the kingdom and take up residence in the countless ruins of the land. The wretched lets their addition to magic overtake them and because of their violent temperament they lack any form of leadership. Although a few notable Wretched have stepped up and organized successful raids on settlements within Quel'thalas' borders, they are considered more of a pest than a true threat to the blood elven society. 

### Wretched Names 
Wretched continue to speak the Thalassian tongue after their addiction took control of them, although their words might be muttered and sentences foul, the high elven language is still very familiar to them. Some amongst the wretched elves are also capable of understanding the common tongue, but this is to be considered a minority.

Their overindulgence leads many wretched into insanity, some forgetting their name entirely, or choosing to take a new one more appropriate to their new state. Wretched use the same naming convention as high and blood elves, but instead of surnames they give themselves titles to describe themselves for others, like *the Reckless* or *the Hungerer*.

## Worgen: Feral
An ancient curse long kept hidden in the emerald dream, the curse of the worgen can transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast. Affected creatures are turned into feral monsters resembling wolves more than intelligent humanoids. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and a glistening red glow in the dark of night.

Some worgen have been cured of their feral nature by the aid of night elven magic. These humanoids continue to carry the curse of the worgen within them, allowing them to shift between the shape of a monstrous humanoid wolf and themselves.

***Pack Animals.*** There is but a shred of humanity left in feral worgens, they have become animals that only think of survival. Feral worgens are formidable hunters capable of finding prey from great distances. Like wolves they work in packs, surrounding their quarry as to insure the kill.

Feral worgens ravage the land in their tireless search for food, hunting animals and humanoids alike. Unlike wolves they don't settle anywhere for long, but ravage a land for its prey before continuing to a new region for food.

***Humanoid Cubs.*** The worgen curse is not in their blood, it affects the individual directly and those it might bite. As a result of that the cubs of a feral worgen is a humanoid child of the race it once was. Although the mother to such a child might carry an affection towards it, the rest of the pack does not and more often than not these children become food to feed the strongest.

***Undeath Resistance.*** The curse of the worgen draws its power from both the emerald dream and the holy power of the goddess Elune. These polar opposite forces to death have made rising worgens into undeath far more difficult than it is for normal humanoids. 

***Feral Weaknesses.*** These feral hunters fear near nothing and will not back down easily. But those who study the beasts have noticed their hate for fire. Worgens tend to avoid areas lit by open flames as much as possible, staying in the shadows as they prowl after their prey.

Worgens also seem to have a poisonous reaction towards the wolfsbane plant, a minuscule flower that grows around the region of Gilneas. The harmless plant has proven to be poisonous towards the worgens as it comes into contact with open wounds. 

> ##### Player Characters as Feral Worgens
> A humanoid bit by a worgen must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed. The curse has no effect on undead beings, such as the forsaken. A character bit begins to show the effects of the curse after 1d4 days, at which point the character is transformed into a feral worgen. It gains a Strength of 15 if their score isn't already higher, and their alignment changes to Chaotic Evil.
>
> The cursed character also gains the following indefinite madness, *"I hunger for the taste of blood and will kill anyone to taste it once more."*
>
> The character remains a feral worgen until a *greater restoration* spell or more powerful magic rids the character of their indefinite madness, at which point alignment returns to what it was before being bit, and the character gains the *Two Forms* feature and the *Worgen Form Traits* of the worgen race.

## Yeti
Yetisâalso called Wendigos in certain parts of the worldâare hulking furry monstrosities that roam snowy regions and remote areas of the world in search for food and survival. They are terrifying and powerful creatures that strike fear into the hearts of weary travelers who wander too close to their dens.

***Territorial Beings.*** Yetis are territorial creatures that roam their land to claim a meal and become immediately hostile towards living creatures who traverse it. But even when driven by hunger the hulking monsters will attack nearby settlements, breaking a perimeter that that might have once daunted them in search of flesh to devour.

***Horrific Dens.*** Most yetis are lone wanders living <br> by themselves in their secluded dens, but yetis are not <br> as unintelligent as they are let out to be and know that <br> there is strength in numbers. Some yetis form larger <br> dens, following the strongest amongst them as they <br> terrorize the land around them, desolating it of food.

### Abonimable Yeti
Enormous and menacing, an abominable yeti raised far above normal yetis, with their backs hunched they take on a more bestial ape-like appearance. Unlike other yetis, abominable yetis are solitary creature that would rather kill intruders than consider working together with them for survival. Though few live long enough to tell their tale evidence of these hulking monsters can be heard through the mountains by their echoing primal roars.

A **lion** is a common sight across central Kalimdor. These fierce predators stalk the tall grass in small packs -- their prides -- and have been known to even hunt travellers.

Thanks for Reading

This has been a project made by a group of people who have loved the Warcraft franchise for many years at this point, and wanted to bring it into Dungeons and Dragons for everyone to enjoy.

This has been a blast for us to make, and we thoroughly enjoy making it and improving upon it. We hope this will bring joy to many D&D tables around the world. Best of luck to all the parties of humans and orcs, try not to chop each other up too much <3

Did you know this was all made using GmBinder? I can't stretch enough how fantastic a tool it is for creating homebrew material for 5th edition D&D.
