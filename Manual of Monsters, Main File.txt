## Foreword </div>
We've made this book in an attempt to bring the beloved Warcraft franchise into the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons. It is a task that has taken us months to do, and it'll likely take many more still. Everyone involved are working this in their spare time, aiming to bring a genuine recreation of *Warcraft* as a D&D 5th Edition tabletop RPG.

This book is made to compliment official D&D 5th edition books, including the **Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide**, and **Monster Manual**. It has been built on the framework set by those books, and designed to be brought in as any supplement book would. Without any more work than to just use the material presented.

It has been written with the intention of always being a free resource for everyone to use. Never to be bought or paid for. We've made this because we want others to enjoy the Warcraft universe under D&D 5th Edition rules. Not for any monetary gain.

With each coming update, all changes will be noted in the Changelog â Link is provided below.

# Chapter 1: Bestiary
THERE IS A BIG WORLD OUT THERE. From the familiar shores of Azeroth and the torn reaches of Draenor, across the Twisting Nether to a thousand worlds within the great cosmic planes. It's no wonder so many take to the call for adventure and seek out on the&shy;ir own, and no surprise to hear of the dang&shy;ers they've found along the way.

This chapter presents creatures found throughout the Warcraft universe. Some of the statistics have been brou&shy;ght over or otherwise adopted from the D&D System Reference Document (SRD) under the Open Gaming License (OGL), while the majority were written by the fans and contributors to this project -- without whom this book would likely be a long way away still.

Here you will find statistics for many classic fantasy RPG staples -- skeletons, yetis, owlbeasts, harpies, gnolls, basi&shy;lisks, ghosts, and more -- as well as numerous creatures iconic to Warcraft; such as the insidious murlocs, the lumbering woodland ancients, and the ever-looming threat of the undead Scourge.

If you are looking for material to run a campaign set within the Warcraft universe, whether with material of your own or with material taken from the *Heroes' Handbook* also written as part of this project, we hope this book will provide you with enough material to keep your players on their toes as they venture through Azeroth and beyond.

### This chapter is not yet finished

As of this first release of our *Manual of Monsters*, this book contains statistics for 179 monsters and miscellaneous creatures suitable for a Warcraft campaign.

In the long run, our full goal is a book of statistics for approximately 600 (and perhaps later, even more) monsters, creatures, and NPCs. From mundane beasts to the great Dragonflights and the infernal armies of the Burning Legion, as well as legendary figures.

## Statistics
A monster's statistics, sometimes referred to as its **stat block**, provide the essential information that you need to run the monster.

### Size
A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. See the 5th edition *Player's Handbook* for more information on creature size and space.

##### Size Categories
|&nbsp; Size       | Space | Examples |
|:-----------------|:-----------|:-:|
|&nbsp; Tiny       | 2Â½ by 2Â½ ft. |
|&nbsp; Small      | 5 by 5 ft. |
|&nbsp; Medium     | 5 by 5 ft. |
|&nbsp; Large      | 10 by 10 ft. |
|&nbsp; Huge       | 15 by 15 ft. |
|&nbsp; Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger |

> ##### Modifying Creatures
> Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this block, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak a creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a **variant** or **template**, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.

### Type
A monster's type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an *arrow of dragon slaying* deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as drakonids and drakeadons.

The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.

**Aberrations** are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature's alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quin&shy;tessential aberrations are forgotten ones, nerubians, and beings of the old gods.

**Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.

\pagebreakNum

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Constructs** are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs.

**Dragons** are reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. The dragonflights are highly intelligent and have innate magic. This category also includes distant relatives of the dragonflights; such as the less powerful and less magical  dragonspawns and proto-drakes.

**Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental plane. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of elemen&shy;tal creatures include ascendants, bound and unbound elementals, and revenants.

**Fey** are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. They are closely tied to the Emerald Dream. Fey include dryads, faerie dragons, and wisps.

**Fiends** are creatures of wickedness native to worlds beyond Azeroth. Many originate from the Great Dark Beyond and its Twisting Nether, others were corrupted on planets far away. Fiends all serve Sargeras the Dark Titan, and in turn the Void Lords themselves. Fiends include demons, infernals, and the Eredar.

**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They are enor&shy;mous creatures created by the titans, many of whom still show the stone shapes of their makers. Giants include sea giants, ogres, breakers, and the vrykul.

**Humanoids** are the main peoples of Azeroth, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, orcs, trolls, and dwarves.

A variety of humanoids appear throughout this book, but the races detailed in the *Heroes Handbook* are dealt with in appendix B. That appendix gives you a number of stat blocks that you can use to make variations of those races.

**Monstrosities** are monsters, frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry, and others are the product of terrible curses. They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into any type.

**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They adapt to their environment, taking on aspects of their surroundings.

**Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the ancients and treants. Fungal creatures such as sporelings and the mandragora also fall into this category.

**Titans** are beings made by titans themselves. Many resemble constructs, being massive creatures made of stone or other inanimate materials. Titans include titan constructs, titanforged, and titanic watchers.

**Undead** are once-living creatures brought to a horrify&shy;ing state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as zombies and the Sanâlayn, as well as bodi&shy;less spirits, such as ghosts and specters.

\columnbreak

#### Tags
A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the human&shy;oid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.

### Alignment
A monster's alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, while a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the *Heroes Handbook* for descriptions of the different alignments.

The alignment specified in a monster's stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster's alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned doomguard or an evil keeper of the grove, there's nothing stopping you.

Some creatures can have **any alignment**. Meaning, you can choose the monster's alignment. Some monster's alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.

Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehen&shy;sion of law or chaos, good or evil. They don't make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are **unaligned**, which means they don't have an alignment.

### Armor Class
A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster's AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.

### Hit Points
A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points.

A monster's hit points are presented both as a die expres&shy;sion and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 x 4Â½).

##### Hit Dice by Size
|&nbsp; Monster Size | Hit Dice | Average HP per Die |
|:-------------------|:---:|:---:|
|&nbsp; Tiny         |  d4 |  2Â½ |
|&nbsp; Small        |  d6 |  3Â½ |
|&nbsp; Medium       |  d8 |  4Â½ |
|&nbsp; Large        | d10 |  5Â½ |
|&nbsp; Huge         | d12 |  6Â½ |
|&nbsp; Gargantuan   | d20 | 10Â½ |

A monster's Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).

### Speed
A monster's speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*.

All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster's speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.

Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

#### Burrow
A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can't burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

#### Climb
A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn't need to spend extra movement to climb.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

#### Fly
A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to **hover**, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as ex&shy;plained in the rules on flying in the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

#### Swim
A monster that has a swimming speed doesn't need to spend extra movement to swim.

### Ability Scores
Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they're used in play, see the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*.

### Saving Throws
The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn't easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don't have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.

A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is deter&shy;mined by the monster's challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).

> ##### Armor, Weapon, & Tool Proficiency
> Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.
>
> For example, an ogre typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip an ogre with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the ogre is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.
>
> See the 5th edition *Player's Handbook* for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.

</div>

### Skills
The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

A skill bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster's challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, <br>and Immunities
Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Additionally, some creatures are immune to certain conditions. If a monster is immune to a game effect that isn't considered damage or a condition, it has a special trait.

\pagebreakNum

### Senses
The Senses entry notes a monster's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.

#### Blindsight
A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.

Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or height&shy;ened senses, such as bats and the dragonflights.

If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.

#### Darkvision
A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.

#### Tremorsense
A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.

#### Truesight
A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.

### Languages
The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can't speak it, and this is noted in its entry.

A "â" indicates that a creature neither speaks nor under&shy;stands any language.

#### Telepathy
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can't initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.

A telepathic monster doesn't need to see the creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiative or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can't initiate telepathic contact, and contact is terminated.

A creature within the area of an *antimagic field* or in any other location where magic doesn't function can't send or receive telepathic messages.

\columnbreak

### Challenge
A monster's **challenge rating** tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat monsters that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.

Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.

Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.

#### Experience Points
The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster although the DM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.

Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.

The 5th edition *Dungeon Master's Guide* explains how to create encounters using XP budgets, as well as how to adjust an encounter's difficulty.

### Special Traits
Special traits (which appear after a monster's challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are character&shy;istics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.

#### Innate Spellcasting
A monster with this innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast as its lowest possible level and can't be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster's challenge rating.

An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a spell might have a "self only" restriction, which means that the spell affects only the caster.

A monster's innate spells can't be swapped out with other spells. If a monster's innate spells don't require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.

#### Spellcasting
A monster with the Spellcasting class feature has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as explained in the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*). The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.

The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a particular class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Priesthood feature of the priest or the Druid Path feature of the druid.

A monster can cast spells from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a creature with the 3rd-level *lightning bolt* spell can cast it as a higher level spell if such a spell slot is available.

You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on a monster's spell list with a different spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating. 

#### Psionics
A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn't require any components to cast its spells.

### Actions
When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Action section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*

#### Melee and Ranged Attacks
The most common action that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the "weapon" might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on the different kinds of attacks, see the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*.

***Creature vs. Target.*** The target of a melee or ranged attack is either one creature or one target, the difference being that a "target" can be a creature or an object

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 2 | INTRODUCTION </div>
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PjJ1cuU.jpg' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:-70px; width:770px' />
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/RORo27J.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:-50px; width:900px' />

\pagebreakNum

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Hit.*** any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the *"Hit"* notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.

***Miss.*** If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss that information is presented after the *"Miss:"* notation.

#### Multiattack
A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack ability. A creature can't use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.

#### Ammunition
A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.

### Reactions
If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.

### Limited Usage
Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.

***X/Day.*** The notation "X/Day" means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to use it again.

***Recharge XâY.*** The notation "Recharge XâY" means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.

For example, "Recharge 5-6" means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster's turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5-6 on a d6.

***Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.*** This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

> ##### Grapple Rules for Monsters
> Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn't need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless said otherwise.
>
> A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try and escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster's stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster's Strength (Athletics) modifier.

\columnbreak

### Equipment
A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.

You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, using the equipment chapter of the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*, and our *Heroes Handbook* for inspiration, and you decide how much of a monster's equip&shy;ment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.

If a monster with spellcasting requires material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.

## Legendary Creatures
A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can't. Legendary creatures can take special actions outside their turns, and a few can exert power over their environ&shy;ment, causing extraordinary magical effects to occur in their vicinity.

### Legendary Actions
A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actionsâcalled legendary actionsâoutside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. A legendary creature regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It isn't required to use its legendary actions, and it can't use legendary actions while incapacitated.

### A Legendary Creature's Lair
A legendary creature might have a section of describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Not all legendary creatures have lairs. This section only applies to legendary creatures that spend a great deal of time in their lairs and are most likely to be encountered there.

#### Lair Actions
If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), the creature can use one of its lair action options, or forgo using any of them that round.

#### Regional Effects
The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.

## <span style="margin-left:76px"></span> Ancients

<span style="margin-left:76px"></span> The Ancients are massive, leaf-covered trees
<span style="margin-left:72px"></span> given life. With an unparalleled wisdom and
<span style="margin-left:64px"></span> insight into the world around them, they act as
<span style="margin-left:60px"></span> guardians of the forests where they dwell -- such
<span style="margin-left:60px"></span> as those of northern Kalimdor, where their
<span style="margin-left:46px"></span> shared bonds with the night elves have kept the
<span style="margin-left:32px"></span> two races in a long-lasting symbiosis.

***Staunch Defenders.*** An ancient is grown from an acorn, like so many other trees, though the acorn itself is far rarer and far more powerful. It takes years upon years for an ancient to grow to its full size, where it stays for thousands of years without feeling the wear of old age.

The ancients who have allied themselves with the honorable night elves stand guard of their cities, and of their border territories. They can burrow their rooted feet into the soil beneath, becoming indistinguishable from a normal tree if they stand perfectly still. This allows both for other creatures to take shelter between its leaves, such as a squirrel with its own acorns, and for the ancient to keep quiet watch over the wilds.

Due to their immense lifespan and often slow, lumbering presence, an ancient sees time differently from mortal races. Often times, years may become akin to hours, minutes, or even seconds.

***Plantlike Creatures.*** An ancient doesn't require food or sleep. Instead, it draws nourishment from the soil and can carry on for weeks without a fresh supply of water.

### Ancient Protector
Most often when the acorn of an ancient sprouts, it grows to become an ancient protector. These hulking trees make up most of the ancients, and are critical in safeguarding night elven civic areas and groves.

### Ancient of Lore
Some ancients grow to become enlightened beings of the forest, wise beyond belief and capable of establishing meaningful contact with the free-spirited dryads. These ancient have a close connection to night elven druids and priests, taking on a role as instructors in the ways of magic and the secrets of nature.

### Ancient of War
The toughest of ancients grow into ancients of war; mighty plants often found defending night elven settle&shy;ments or supporting Alliance forces in battle. Embodied in these ancient guardians are the spirits of courage and determination, which they wield to call upon the forest itself to rise in order to turn the tide of battle in favour of them and their allies.

On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again.  If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

## Basilisk
Sometimes, travelers find carved
<br> stone statues of people or wildlife that
<br> look remarkably lifelike. Sometimes these statues are whole. Other times, the parts that are missing appear to have been bitten off. Seasoned explorers regard such relics as a warning, know&shy;ing that the basilisk resposible is likely to still be close by.

***Territorial Creatures.*** Although basilisks are powerful creatures, and fierce combatants, they rarely exhibit a deliberately cruel or violent intent. Basilisks live as solitary predators, sometimes in small colonies, and keep a watch&shy;ful eye on the borders of their territory. From their domain, they prefer to hunt those who choose to trespass, leaving behind petrified chunks of whatever remains.

***Gaze of Stone.*** As far as predators go, basilisks are often slow and ponderous creatures, as they rarely need to chase their prey. Meeting a basilisk's supernatural gaze can be enough to rapidly transform their prey into stone -- which the basilisk then breaks apart with its strong jaws, perfectly capable of tearing down the stone for nutrition.

***A Fondness for Crystals.*** Though many scholars have examined the basilisk's inherent attraction to crystals, there is no agreement as to why the lumbering beasts exhibit such fondness for them.

They exhibit great fondness for crystalline structures and are capable of sensing them from a great distance, which they will gladly traverse -- in groups or by their lonesome -- to retrieve their coveted prize. Basilisks have such an insatiable hunger for such crystals, it is not uncommon to find colonies that have begun to sprout crystal formations across their rocky hides, as a side-effect of their gluttonous diet.

In Stranglethorn Vale, especially, some colonies have taken to forming their nests from these same crystals, making for an attractive gamble for any adventurers daring enough to come face to face with the terrifying beasts.

## Bog Beasts
A bog beast is a massive, shambling monster made of plants, roots, and flesh. Inhabiting bogs and swamps, they hide away beneath the water surface, disguising them&shy;selves as thick, waterlogged lumps of vegetation. There they wait patiently for any unaware critters to venture too close -- or better yet, unaware adventurers.

***Creatures of Mystery.*** Bog beasts are frightful crea&shy;tures, and notoriously elusive. They are adept at avoiding the gaze of scholars attempting to study them; and for many who have tried, only moss-riddled remains have been found. Their aggressive, territorial nature makes them a considerable danger to any unfortunate enough to cross paths with them.

***Plants Anatomy.*** Thick roots stretch across the entirety of the bog beast's form, as if to conceal what hides under&shy;neath. It is speculated that they have no real need for sustenance apart from the waters they dwell in, and some have been observed spending months still in the murky depths -- only barely grasping the surface to draw breath.

***Naturally Powerful.*** Explorers who have encountered a bog beas and lived to tell the tale, describe them as immen&shy;sely powerful and resilient to harm. Their massive limbs can quickly overwhelm their enemies, crushing opponents with their fists or with whatever nearby objects they can throw.

### Timberling
A timberling is by many considered the child of bog beasts, very similar and yet considerably smaller at a height comparable to that of a dwarf. As far as bog beasts go, timberlings are fairly peaceful creatures that live in harmony with the land. However, any disruption to their habitat will quickly drive them into an unnatural frenzy.

### Thistleshrub
Thistleshrubs, unlike most bog beasts, do not dwell in swamps or marshes. Instead they prefer arid climates, and bear resemblence to a large mass of withered vines cov&shy;ered in sharp briars. They are known to be very hostile, and will certainly attack anyone foolish enough to approach; sporadically lashing out with whip-like thorns at anything that comes near.

### Swampwalker
These hulking masses are rarely ever witnessed outside of dense swamps, and blend perfectly into their chosen habitat with their dark green and brown colors.

They are both the most territorial and the most cunning among bog beasts, and have been witnessed deliberately attempting to lure travellers farther into their lair in order to spring a trap. Their natural camouflage allows them to move through their territory entirely unseen, and have left adventurers wary even of rippling water and rustling leaves when venturing through swamps.

### Tar Creeper
Cherishing humid air and temperatures, the tar creeper is by far the most abormal of all bog beasts for its viscous, tar-like appearance. Not to mention the most dangerous.

Though they might seem slow, these massive beasts can cut through tar like a fish through water; lunging forth to trap their prey and drag it back down below.

## Centaurs
Abundant across the plains of central and southern Kalimdor, the centaur are a race of half-horse humanoids, appearing as a human's torso, arms, and head extending from the neck of an equine body. Full-grown centaurs stand over seven feet tall, hooves to head, and weigh over a ton.

***Nomadic Culture.*** They keep in small nomadic tribes, roaming the broad regions they consider their territory, with regular spots by which they settle their tents to hunt and forage. Each tribe is lorded by its khan, who'll more often than not keep open conflict with both neighboring tribes and races alike.

While on their warpath, travelling from place to place, centaurs often claim prisoners during their raids. Usually, these prisoners are tortured, driven to exhaustion, and eventually eaten.

***Cycle of Conflict.*** Though many attempts have been made, either between tribes or at the behest of tauren settlements in a tribe's warpath, the centaur have never been ones for diplomacy. 

Both the Horde and the Alliance have done their part to feed this inter-tribal conflict, seeing it as a necessary act to keep scattered clans, especially in regions such as the Barrens or Desolace, from banding together and becoming a more dangerous foe.

### Centaur Earthcaller
Though centaurs follow a shamanistic faith, their rites and rituals are unqiue; given their heritage as children of the elemental princess Theradras. Earthcallers are commonly female centaurs, acting as shamans of their tribes as they wield the power to rain elemental earth upon their foes.

### Centaur Khan
At the heart of each centaur tribe is the khan, who acts as leader both for their great intelligence and their unmatched ferocity. Rage and savagery are key to the centaur khans, allowing them to lead their tribe into battle as a fearless commander without equal.

### Centaur Names and Language
The centaur speak Low Common, and often learn phrases from the languages of their enemies; including Common, Orcish, Goblin, and Taur-ahe. A few centaurs  even go as far as to learn the entirety of these languages, with fewer still adopting this second language as their primary language.

Their names are short and sharp, while tribes draw their name from the first khan to lead them -- such as khan Gelk of the Gelkis. The ending of a tribe's name sits at the whim of its first khan, it is speculated that they draw these from other languages spoken by the tribe's founding members.

> ##### The Children of Zaetar
> The centaur are the progeny of Zaetar, a Keeper of the Grove and son of Cenarius; Lord of the forest and Demigod of the Groves. Though Zaetar was no lesser than his brother, Remulos, he often felt himself living in the shadow of his brother's presence and accomplishments.
>
> When Cenarius sent his son Zaetar out to investigate the re-emergence of the elemental princess Theradras, daughter of Therazane the Stonemother, Zaetar saw himself enchanted by Theradras' beauty.
>
> The two became mates, in secrecy, and out of their forbidden union the centaur were born. Zaetar realized his deed upon seeing the centaurs, who in turn saw the disgust in their father's eyes and brutally murdered him. Therazane chastised them for the deed, for which the centaurs promised to honor Zaetar's memory to please their beloved mother.
>
> Theradras entombed her lover's spirit within her own lair, which the centaur gave the name Maraudon and grew to regard as a sacred place.

## Core Hounds
Most who venture to Blackrock Mountain would rather face a squad of orcs than confront a single core hound. These hulking bulldogs drip of magma as they trail, guard&shy;ing the molten core of the black mountain -- as well as the scorched earth of the lands around.

A core hound's body is covered in thick, sweltering metal plates, with streaks of fire running the length of its back. Its mouth is filled with rows of sharp teeth, said to be hotter than white-hot steel.

***Faithful Servants.*** Core hounds are the faithful servants of the Firelord and his minions, and in many ways do act like loyal dogs in that regard, following the will of their fiery master as best they can. 

***Endless Growth.*** If allowed, a core hound can grow for an eternity, ultimately becoming hulking titans of gargan&shy;tuan size -- like their progenitor, Magmadar. Few core hounds ever manage to reach such a size, as often their aggressive nature becomes their downfall.

The dark iron hounds, considered misshapen by true core hounds, cease to grow once they reach maturity.

### Core Hound
The core hound is a monstrous, vicious, two-headed bulldog with a faithful bond to the Firelord Ragnaros and his minions. Waves of scorching heat emanate from the core hound's body, and those who engage it with head-on quickly find their weapons rendered useless as each slash and stab melts it all away.

They are are ferocious, unforgivable beings. Hostility toward intruders is always a given, as they are impossible to reason with. They take orders solely from the Firelord's rank and file, or from the Firelord himself.

### Dark Iron Hound
A dark iron hounds is smaller, one headed, core hound. They are often seen accompanying the dark iron dwarves who dwell within Blackrock Mountain.

These hounds are often used as mounts by the dark iron dwarves that keep them, though they do not take well to others.

## Dinosaurs
Dinosaurs are among the oldest reptiles in the world. For the most part, they split into two groups: savage, territorial predators, and docile but still undeniably dangerous herbivores.

These creatures come in many sizes and shapes, with a wide variety of markings and colorations between them. They roam far and wide across Azeroth, all the way from remote mountain valleys to humid jungles and rugged barren plains.

### Raptor
The raptor is an aggressive theropod predator, known for its great strength and speed. It is fast enough to chase down near anything out in the open, and prefers to pounce on its prey in order to trap it. Then, it tears flesh from bone with its long, curved claws and razor-sharp teeth.

### Threshadon
A plesiosaurus is a marine dinosaur whose compact body is driven by powerful flippers. An aggressive predator, it attacks any creature that it encounters. Its flexible neck accounts for a third of its total length, allowing it to twist in any direction in order to deliver its powerful bite.

## Dragonhawks
Travelers entering the enchanted forests of Quel'Thalas might catch a glimpse of the mystical dragonhawk gliding above the trees. An unusual warmth hangs in the air, as the majestic beast vanishes out of sight.

***Bred for War.*** The elves of Quel'Thalas have a long standing tradition domesticating dragonhawks. They are vicious flying predators, swift and deft, able to crack bones and pierce hides with their long talons, and the elves have long mastered training them for use as aerial mounts. Majestic and magnificent creatures, dragonhawks and their elven riders make for an impressive sight.

***Wild Legends.*** Few wild dragonhawks still exist. Most the beasts found in Quel'Thalas, if not all, are kept by the elves. Wild ones are near-mythical beings that few ever witness, as they stay clear of their tamed kin and have become masters of avoiding detection. These dragonhawks are formidable hunters and among the deadliest predators found on the Eastern Kingdoms.

## Dust Devil
A dust devil is an elemental of air and earth. Roaring out across the land, these violent vortexes can spell a real problem for any  nearby settlements, as their chaotic nature makes them prone to cause great upheaval.

***Eternal Nuisance.*** Dust devils find an unusual enjoy&shy;ment in their uncanny roaming, destroying whatever they come across in their path by sending forth incredible gusts of wind or by tearing it asunder with their hands.

***Conjured by Magic.*** Certain spells and magic items can conjure forth elementals from the Elemental Plane to the Material Plane. Elementals, and dust devils in particular, resent this treatment and the shackles of servitude that comes with it. A creature that summons an elemental must assert the force of will to control it.

***Elemental Nature.*** A dust devil doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Dwarves: Dark Iron
Known for their fiery tempers and fierce determination, the Dark Iron clan of dwarves has a history of strife with the other dwarven clans, as well as within their own ranks. Twisted by the influence of Ragnaros the Firelord, they are a greedy, cruel, and despotic kind.

Most dark iron dwarves have hair as red as fire or black as coal, trickling with ember flakes, and skin the colour of ash. Though their clothes are drab and dark, their ornate style and lavish jewelry is a prominent display of status.

***Legacy of Thaurissan.*** In ages past, the Dark Iron clan cut out their own from the Bronzebeard clan of Ironforge and the Wildhammer clan of Grim Batol. Sworn to revenge on his dwarven king, the Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan and his wife Modgud led their clansfolk to the southern borders of Khaz Modan, into the far-reaching stretches of the Redridge Mountains.

There, founding the city of Thaurissan, the clan let their hatred seethe and and their forces swell, before they ultimately led a two-pronged assault on both Ironforge and Grim Batol. Thaurissan himself was routed by the Bronzebeards at Ironforge and his wife saw her end to the Wildhammers at Grim Batol. The Dark Iron clan fled back to their home in the Redridge Mountains, where they were ultimately cornered by their dwarven kin -- intent to wipe Thaurissan's legacy from the continent.

***Rise of the Firelord.*** To avoid a seemingly inevitable defeat, Thaurissan attempted to summon forth and ancient power that had been left sleeping beneath the earth. What he brought forth was the Firelord, Ragnaros, once locked away by the Titans when the world was still young.

The towering elemental Lord rose forth, unleashed from his prison, in an apocalyptic rebirth that shattered the Redridge Mountains. At the center of the devastation, a volcano rose forth to spew ash and molten rock across the land. This volcano became known as Blackrock Mountain. The smoldering crater of destruction to its north became known as the Searing Gorge, while the lifeless reaches to its south became the Burning Steppes.

Though Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan himself was killed in the eruption, both the legacy of his name and the legacy of his surviving clansfolk have lived on. Enslaved by the Ragnaros the Firelord and his elemental hordes.

***Shadowforge City.*** For decades on after, the Dark Iron clan lived in servitude to their elemental master. Not as thralls in chains, but as devoted warriors under the Firelord's scalding banner. Following on in the footsteps the Sorcerer-Thane's legacy was the son of him and his wife Modgud; Dagran Thaurissan, crowned emperor of the Dark Iron clan and their new home beneath Blackrock Mountain: Shadowforge City.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Born in Flames.*** Like other dwarves, dark iron dwarves have strong constitution. Adding to their formidable stamina is an incredible affinity to fire -- a gift granted to them by their long servitude to Ragnaros the Firelord. 

Though fire can still harm them, the soot-stained skin of a dark iron dwarf shields them well from the smoldering fires at the heart of Blackrock Mountain.

***Conflicted Kin.*** The dark iron dwarves have long nurtured conflict with the other dwarven clans. A failed coup in Ironforge ignited the War of the Three Hammers, which in turn became the catalyst that ultimately brought forth Ragnaros. Worse still, the dwarves remain as split within their own ranks as they are with the other clans. 

Open conflicts between independent groups and splintered factions is a common occurrence within the blackened halls beneath the mountain.

### Dark Iron Sorcerer
For those among the dark iron dwarves who lack the strength to train as warriors, a few hold the privilige to instead pursue the study of magic. Sorcerers within the Dark Iron clan have unlocked the power to harness their inner fire, and even yield some control of the mountain's elemental forces from their master. This power seats them at the heart of clan.

### Dark Iron Overseer
The Dark Iron Overseers keep the daily operations of the clan's numerous prospects -- both within Blackrock Mountain and out across the surrounding landscape. The Searing Gorge, in particular, has proven beyond valuable for its mithril and truesilver.

As the tireless work of the dark iron work drudges on, the overseers stand with hateful smiles on their faces, cracking the whips that drive their labouring thralls forward.

### Dark Iron Herald
Heralds stand at the pinnacle of dark iron society. They are the voice of their kin, the mouth through which the Firelord 
enacts his will upon the dwarves. Their presence brings
<br> <span style="margin-left:10px"></span> forth the fiery temper that has become the clan's legacy; 
<br> <span style="margin-left:20px"></span> driving dwarves around them to fanatical extremes. 

<span style="margin-left:50px"></span> To this end, they have been bestowed with the 
<br> <span style="margin-left:80px"></span> power to weave devastating spells and 
<br> <span style="margin-left:95px"></span> conjure forth the Firelord's minions to 
<br> <span style="margin-left:110px"></span> their own aid.

## Elementals
Elementals are as ageless as they are unchanging; volatile beings of raw elemental power, manifested in physical form. Since the early days of creation, as life hurdled through the cosmos and manifested itself upon countless worlds, the most common primordial form of life has been the elementals -- who now populate nearly every world spanning across the great dark beyond, nourishing themselves off of the energies within.

***Bound to the Elemental Plane.*** On Azeroth, as the titanic Keepers saw to the ordering of the world, they found the elementals wreaking havoc under the corrupting influence of the Old Gods. As a safeguard, to protect their intended new denizens of the planet from such a destructive force, the Keepers constructed the Elemental Plane as a prison in which the elementals could be locked away, free to roam at their own behest. In their absence, the Keepers could tend to their task at hand; settling the natural order of Azeroth.

The Elemental Plane is divided into four interlinked regions, each existing within its own pocket dimension as a representation of its associated element: The Abyssal Maw, domain of water; Deepholm, domain of earth; the Firelands, domain of fire; and Skywall, domain of air.

***An Eternity of Conflict.*** Though the domains within the Elemental Plane are intended to be sealed off, none of them accessible from the others, the elementals have never ceased their endless strife with one another. By what means they can, whether by breaching the walls of their domain to invade another or by taking their conflict to the physical plane with the help of mortal hands, the elementals are quick to clash as they meet -- sometimes waging battles of titanic proprtions.

***The Ordering of Elements.*** Though elementals are chaotic and violent by nature, some more so than others, they themselves follow a strict ordering of power within their elemental domain.

Above all other sits the Elemental Lords; beings of untamed power, whose sum can be considered even larger than most else existing within their realm. They hold power over their domain within the Elemental Plane, subjugating lesser elementals to carry out their bidding. It is said that if magic drawing power from the Elemental Plane is cast in the presence of the Elemental Lord governing that particular elemental domain, it may well fall to said Lord to take control of the spell at their own whim.

Carrying out the bidding of the Elemental Lords are their lieutenants. While nowhere near as powerful as their respective Lord, it is not uncommon for an elemental lieutenant to wield both great power and agency in carrying out their master's bidding.

***Elemental Nature.*** A elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:140px;'></div>

### Air Elemental
Taking form as a swirling storm, or a billowing cloud given faint humanoid shape, an air elemental holds command of wind and weather. Fast and silent, it strikes out by enveloping its foes in a blinding whirlwind to seize the upper hand.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

### Arcane Elemental
Appearing in areas suffused with arcane energy, these ele&shy;mentals manifest from its energy and are often found in the service of mages, feeding of the fluctuation of magic from their spells.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

### Earth Elemental
Near indistinguishable from rocks if standing still, an earth elemental is as hardy and steadfast as the element it embodies. It burrows through the ground with utmost ease, and faces its opponents head-on if engaged.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

### Fire Elemental
A fire elemental manifests as a smoldering pillar of unwavering destruction. While susceptible to water, it is a cunning presence that will often attempt to overwhelm and outright engulf those who try to stand in its way.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

### Ice Elemental
Manifest from frozen water, ice elementals share domain and allegiance with other water elementals. It moves unhindered through the icy reaches in which it dwells, and is very quick to enrage at the sight of fire wielded in its vicinity.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

### Water Elemental
A favoured companion among mages, human mages in particular, a water elemental is near impossible to discern while underwater. If able, it often attempts to deal with threats by luring them along into the water -- and from there, drag them along into the murky depths.

> ##### Variant: Elemental Revenant
> An elemental revenant is a furious elemental being that has manifested itself with a crude suit of armor for protection.
>
>A revenant has the same statistics as its elemental counterpart, except for an Armor Class of 17 (half plate, shield). It loses any ability to move through and stop in the space of other creatures, as well as any ability to move through spaces smaller than 2 feet, its slam or touch action is replaced with the following option, using the same attack modifier and damage type as the original action.
>
> ***Maul.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d12 + 5) damage of the elemental's type.

## Faceless Ones
The faceless ones are a monstrous kin, brought forth from the organic matter that seeped away from the Old Gods in primordial times, before the Titans brought about the ordering of Azeroth. Cunning and intelligent, they serve their eldritch masters with fanatical devotion. Tales of their unspeakable deeds paint them as unstoppable juggernauts.

***Spawn of the Old Gods.*** The faceless ones are the creation of the Old Gods, in the most literal sense of the word. They are shaped from the Old Gods' own flesh and blood; trickled from their eternal prisons through the core of the planet, like bile through the gutters.

Some of these aberrations are unique, while others are so unfirom as to be virtually identical. They are all loyal to the gods that spawned them forth, unwavering in their devotion to the will of their creators.

***Unexpected Allies.*** These eldritch horrors are powerful, but not innumerable. What they lack in either is quickly recouped by corrupting other beings that happen in their path. Even a faceless one on its own is almost guaranteed to never truly be alone.

The faceless ones keep a few valuable allies, such as the Naga, while simultaneously seeding hatred and distrust even among the most loyal of factions.

***Corrupting Presence.*** Faceless ones carry the stain of the Old Gods with the, wherever they go, and their presence alone can change things for the worse. Life is tainted in their wake, slowly twisted around as friends become foes and alliances dissolve into bitter hatred.

Whether by instilling paranoia or asserting dominance directly, the faceless ones will always seek to divide and conquer.

***Return of the Black Empire.*** The Old Gods once ruled over Azeroth, in a time long before mortal races saw the light of day. Locked away by the Titans, they have long ever since to return to power -- an end to which their faceless severants are the means by which they act.

Long have they sown the seeds of corruption, turning the denizens of the world against one another, so that they can break free and seize control once more.

### Zoatroid
Many would see the small, squid-like zoatroid as utterly inconsequential. Nowhere near as dangerous as the towering n'raqi. Fools are those who underestimate them, as these merciless critters hunt to gain complete of their victims -- which they do by latching onto the face of a suitable target in order to bore into its mind.

Zoatroids have found a second home among the Naga, saiding their serpentine allies by infiltrating and corrupting their enemies. Some zoatroids are only able to seize control of a creature's body, while others are able to claim both body and mind as their own.

>
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Magic Resistance.*** The zoatroid has advantage on 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; saves against spells and other magical effects.
>
> <br>The royal zoatroid has the following action option in place of the zoatroid's Enslave:
>
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Dominate (Recharge 6).*** One humanoid grappled 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; by the zoatroid must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; saving throw or be dominated by the zoatroid: the 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; dominated target goes on the zoatroids initiative, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; it controls the target using its action. The *Domi-*
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; *nate* deprives the target of its vision but not its 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; awareness. The royal zoatroid can be targeted by 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; attacks, spells, and other effects but any attack roll 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; that misses the zoatroid automatically hits its 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; dominated target.
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The domination lasts until the target drops to 0 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; hit points, the zoatroid ends it as a bonus action, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; or a creature uses their action to attempt a 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; grapple check contested by the zoatroid.

The enslave deprives the target of its vision but not its awareness. The zoatroid can be targeted by attacks, spells, and other effects, but any attack roll that misses it automatically hits its enslaved target.
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enslavement lasts until the target drops to 0 hit points, the zoatroid ends it as a bonus action, or a creature uses their action to attempt a grapple check contested by the zoatroid.
>
> ***Fogged Mind (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Each non-aberration creature within 10 feet of the zoatroid must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Reactive Shield.*** The zoatroid forces an attack roll that would hit it to instead hit its enslaved target. To do so, the zoatroid must be able to see the attacker.

In addition, at the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes 7 (2d6) acid damage.

Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 3 (1d6) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

## Fleshbeast
Though the exact origin of these monstrous aberrations is unknown, the theories are many. Some even go so far as to claim them a product of the Twisting Nether itself, pulled from there onto other worlds.

***Nightmare Made Flesh.*** Slavering, hungering monstro&shy;sities, the best way to describe the terrifying fleshbeasts are plainly as creatures of nightmare. Their presence has been witnessed both on Azeroth and beyond, as they appear to tail along on magical experiments that try to exploit the powers of the Twisting Nether, using them as rifts through which they can travel between worlds.

***Parasitic Brood.*** Fleshbeasts are decidedly mindless, acting entirely on instinct. They hunt by flocking together in large swarms, overpowering their prey and consuming it, sometimes while it is still alive. Even after the fleshbeast has had its fill, most of the victim will still be left behind intact -- a perfect nesting ground for their wormlike spawn, who will later devour the remains as they hatch.

Other predators attempting to scavenge remains left behind by a fleshbeast will most likely be infected as well, and later devoured by the hatchlings.

## Furbolg
Furbolgs are large, kind-hearted creatures. Resembling humanoid bears, they form tribal settlements in caves, forest thickets, and other defensible locations. Though they have care little for conflict, they appear particularly susceptible to corruption.

***Peaceful Nature.*** Furbolgs are a peaceful race, wishing to live for themselves with as little outside interference as they can. They keep a close tie to nature and worship the ancient bear twins; Ursoc and Ursol.

Their tribes can grow exceptionally large, though they are masters at staying secluded from the world around. A furbolg tribe is its family, and tension within is rare. Most tribes are led by its wisest, oldest shaman.

***Corrupted Kin.*** Perhaps leading to their secluded nature, furbolgs have been shown to be easily manipulated by outside forces. As the lands around have blightened, trubes have been transformed into vicious, hateful packs.

Many such tribes lost their ways to the Burning Legion's invading forces, as well as to the corrupting influence of the Old Gods.  Turned away from their kin and onto a bloody path of war.

### Furbolg Names and Languages

> ##### Variant: Furbolg Shaman
> Some furbolgs devote themselves to becoming a shaman for their tribe. A furbolg shaman gains the Spellcasting trait.
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** The furbolg is a 3rd-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following shaman spells

## Ghosts
While most mortal souls eventually find their way to the Shadowlands, not all who have died manage to find rest. Some are unwillingly bound to roam the trackless wastes that exist between the Shadowlands and the physical world, appearing in the latter as ghostly apparitions as they search for release from their endless suffering.

***Existing Between Worlds.*** There are many reasons for why a soul would remain. Curses and deliberate magical entrapment are both common, though the most prevalent are souls unwilling to abandon the physical realm -- also known as the Material Plane -- for the realm of spirits. A person whose life ended abruptly at the hands of someone else is very likely to return as a malevolent spectre, seeking to exact revenge upon those who did them wrong.

Conversely, other spirits may be unwilling to find rest out of fear for what lies beyond, or for a feeling that their life never really reached its full potential.

***Bitter Resentment.*** It is not uncommon for ghosts, especially those forced to dwell in this state for too long, to grow resentful of the living. Unable to accept their own death, and envious of those still living, they grow to foster a seething hatred for warmth, hope, and joy. The presence of such may even drive them into a murderous frenzy.

***The Shadowlands.*** Shaped before mortal life even walked the universe, the Shadowlands is a realm of existence spanning all known worlds, including Azeroth. Those who have seen it describe it as a nightmarish world of decay; a labyrinth of intertwined spiritual planes all teeming with the souls of the dead.

Many believe this to be the final destination for all mortal souls. The realm into which they are drawn in death, destined to remain forever after. Others choose to hope for their final rest to be brighter -- more pleasant than an eternity languishing such cold and bleak confines.

Within the Shadowlands, time does not pass as it would elsewhere. Sometimes, years outside of the Shadowlands may only seem like days within. Sometimes, a year passed by within this bleak domain takes little more than a minute, or perhaps an hour, in the physical realm. While it it is often next to impossible to see what lies ahead inside the Shadowlands, it is possible for those within to hear whispered fragments of what is happening outside.

It is said that Icecrown, the frozen peak of Northrend and citadel of the Scourge, exists as an anchoring bridge between the Shadowlands and the physical world.

Some of the most prominent beings dwelling in the Shadowlands are regarded as patrons of death among various races; such as Bwonsamdi, the troll Loa of death.

Also prominent are the Spirit Healers; ascendant Val'kyr who, following the banishment of Helya and the sealing of the Halls of Valor, disappeared into the Shadowlands -- hidden away there, even from the corrupting influence of the Lich King.

> ##### The Spirit Healers
>
> The first of the Val'kyr was the titanic Watcher Helya, bound by the Keeper Odyn to an eternal servitude as the bringer of souls to his gilded Halls of Valor: the golden realm for all slain spirits of Odyn's followers. Her servitude was not willing, but a punishment, and one for which she had let her hatred for Odyn simmer for millennia.
>
> When the Keeper Loken came with a promise of a way out, and subsequently broke her chains, she called upon her powers to bend the arcane energies of Azeroth into an impregnable seal around Odyn's halls, its inhabitants sealed within.
>
> Free from her servitude, Helya forged the mist-shrouded realm of Helheim as a new home for herself and her Val'kyr, though not all chose to follow her on this path. Instead, some chose to break bonds and disappear into the Shadowlands.
>
> There, just as they once guided fallen vrykul to the Halls of Valor, these Val'kyr have dubbed themselves *Spirit Healers*. From their refuge in the Shadowlands, they have kept an eye on those who enter the dark beyond, and have on occasion granted passage back for those they've found worthy.
>
> ***Encountering a Spirit Healer.*** If your adventurers have met an untimely demise and their quest rem&shy;ains unsolved, seeking out a Spirit Healer within the Shadowlands could be an option for them. The Spirit Healer may judge, or other&shy;wise be convinced, that it is not yet their time and return them to the realm of the living.

### Apparition
An apparition is a spectral impression whose presence in the Material Plane has been caught in flux with the latent energies from a nearby ley line or other font of magical power. As a result, apparitions wield the power to weave their anguish and their resentment into powerful, often harrowing spells.

### Banshee
A banshee is the tormented remnant of an elven woman, whose death came to pass in the most gruesome manner -- with the fall of the Highborne, the first coming of the Bur&shy;ning Legion, and the fall of Quel'Thalas all noteworthy events from which banshees have been formed.

Robbed of their elven gift of immortality, the banshees were left to wander the world in tormented silence until they were discovered by Ner'zhul, the first Lich King. In return for a promise of servitude to the Scourge, Ner'zhul gifted the banshees their terrible, blood-curdling voice, which they in turn have used to enact their revenge. 

Though some banshees still roam free in their own lamentation, most remain beholden to their bond with the Scourge. Some banshees, particularly those formed after the fall of Quel'Thalas, have since found new purpose among the Forsaken.

### Shade
Shades are much alike other ghosts, appearing as disembodied spirits left to wander the reaches between the physical realm and the darkness beyond. This, however, is as far as the similarities go.

While other ghostly beings are the remnants of those unwilling or unable to accept death, shades are formed through willing sacrifice: necromancers offering up their acolytes to better serve the undead Scourge.

Empowered by the Lich King, shades can remain unseen if they will it, detectable only by powerful magic. This allows them to act as the eyes and ears of their undead masters.

### Spectre
Much like the banshee, a spectre is the tormented remnant of an elven man, slain by monstrous foes and robbed of their immortality. Though spectres do not possess the anguished screams for which banshees are known and feared, they still remain a considerable danger to those who encounter them.

Driven both by a bitter resentment for the living and by their hubris in death, a spectre may attempt to lure unwary travelers into dangerous traps, waiting for an opportune moment to overpower them and seep away their life force.

### Wisp
Wisps are the disembodied spirits of deceased night elves, made one with the forest in their passing. Unlike other ghosts who wander the world in anguish, wisps use their spiritual being to bridge a connection ever closer to the forests where they delve.

Though silent for all but a soft, quiet humming, wisps are able to communicate with the living. Acting together in unison with the tree-like ancients, they act as guardians and caretakers -- often flourishing around druidic groves.

\columnbreak

### Wraith
Though they are beholden to their masters -- whether they necromantic cults or the undead Scourge -- wraiths are notorious for how they retain most of their intelligence and in&shy;dividuality, even in death. Self-motivated and exception&shy;ally cunning, it is not uncommon for a wraith to act by its own accord, in defiance of its master's plan.

Some wraiths may be found holding to the same sense of honour and law as they did in life, and may even be willing to negotiate with the living if prompted. Other wraiths, meanwhile, offer little more than a jealous rage for those who approach them. Spurred by a resentment for their undead state, these wraiths readily yearn for a chance to visit their anguish upon any unfortunate enough to cross their path.

### Ghost Template
Ghosts are the spectral remnants of intelligent beings who, for one reason or another, cannot rest easily in their graves. A ghost greatly resembles its corporeal form in life, but in some cases the spiritual form can be altered.

When a creature becomes a ghost, it retains its statistics unless otherwise is stated below. The ghost loses any trait that assumes a living physiology.

***Type.*** The ghost's type is undead, and it loses any tags. It no longer requires air, food, drink or sleep.

***Speed.*** The ghost loses its original movement speed and gains fly 40 ft. (hover).

***Senses.*** The ghost has darkvision with a radius of 60 ft.

***Damage Resistances.*** The ghost gains resistance to acid, fire, lightning, thunder; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks

***Damage Immunities.*** The ghost gains immunity to cold, necrotic and poison damage.

***Condition Immunities.*** The ghost can't be charmed, exhaustion, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained

***Ethereal Sight.*** The ghost can see 60 ft. into the Spirit World when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

***New Action: Etherealness.*** The ghost enters the Spirit World from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Spirit World, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.

***Hit Points.*** If the creature already has three or more damage resistances or immunities, its hit points remain unchanged. Otherwise, the creature's hit points are reduced by a multiplier based on its challenge rating. 

Using the Hit Points Based on Challenge Rating table, apply the appropriate multiplier to the creature's hit points to determine ghost's hit point.

#####  Hit Points Based on Challenge Rating
| Creature <br> Challenge Rating  | HP Multiplier |
|:-----------:|:------:|
|  1-10       | x 0.5  |
|  11-16      | x 0.65 |
|  17 or more | x 0.8  |

All other creatures within 30 feet of her that can hear her must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d12) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
> ***Possession (1/Day).*** One humanoid that the banshee can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the banshee; the banshee then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The banshee now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The banshee can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

>

> ***Intertwine.*** The wisp enters the space of another creature and attempts entwine it in place. The target must pass a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of the target's turns, it can make another save, ending the paralysis on a successful one. While the wisp has a creature intertwined, attack rolls against it has disadvantage. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this wisp's intertwine for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Renew (Recharge 5-6).*** One plant that the wisp can see within 5 feet of it is renewed by the wisp; the wisp disappears. The wisp can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect while renewing a plant. The renewed plant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the plant takes fire damage, the renew doesn't function at the start of its next turn. The plant dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points.
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The renew lasts until the renewed plant drops to 0 hit points, the wisp ends it as a bonus action. When the plant takes damage, the wisp must pass a Concen&shy;tration saving throw (as if concentrating on a spell) or be pushed out of the plant.

The wraith spawn has the same statistics as the wraith, except that it has an Intelligence and Charisma score of 1, it cannot speak or use Create Spawn, and its Life Drain does not reduce a target creature's hit point maximum. The wraith can have no more than two wraith spawns active under its control at one time.

## Gnolls
Gnolls are feral humanoids, resembling bipedal hyenas. They are known attack frontier settlements and unsuspect&shy;ing hamlets without warning, rushing their way through to grab whatever they can escape with.

***Rampant Scavengers.*** Gnolls are notorious for how they hunt. Even those fortunate enough to spot a pack settling their camp might only have hours at best to prepare, before the gnolls come charging in to plunder.

In their wake, they leave little more than razed buildings, burnt crops, and gnawed remains. The easier their target, the better. If they perceive no threat to the pack after the raid has been done, they might stick around in one location for longer. If they fear retaliation from armed guards, like a nearby garrison, the pack will abandon what they must in order to move on as soon as they can.

***Hungering Nomads.*** Gnolls are not known for leaving anything lasting. Their weapons and armour are all scavenged from their victims, alongside trophies sewn into their patchwork clothing -- ears, teeth, scalps, and more.

To a gnoll, meat is meat. Once they've gone for the kill, they will gnaw the bones to the marrow. Though they are intelligent beasts, they won't go shy of cannibalizing rival packs and outcasts if they are hungry enough. Even if one of their own die in a fight, they'll try to drag the corpse away in order to eat it later.

### Gnoll Brute
Gnolls are known for their immense strength, though some of them show it better than the rest. A gnoll brute is hardly intelligent, but it is guaranteed to be ferocious without equal.

### Gnoll Mystic
Some gnolls are sensitive to the elemental forces coursing through the world. Though the powers they wield would be considered novice for true mages, these gnolls are both feared and respected by their pack; elevated to the title of mystics and regarded as wise beyond compare.

### Gnoll Pack Lord
The alpha of a gnoll pack is its pack lord. Keeping a steel-jawed hold on any gnoll following it, the pack lord claims first pick from the pack's raids, and many have been witnessed wearing ornate decor in the form of piercing and grotesque trophies.

### Gnoll Names and Language
Gnolls speak Low Common and Gnoll; presumably a guttural offshoot of the former. Their names are often just descriptions, aiming to intimidate. A pack lord chooses the name for its pack in a similar fashion.

<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

**Gnoll Names:** Dirtpaw, Cackler, Blackfang, White-Eye
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Snarlface, Loose-Tooth, Yowler

## Golems
Though a golem is made from humble materials â flesh and bones, metal and stone â its creation is a complex process, wrought with magic. At the hands of a skilled creator, their power, durability, and potential is nothing short of astonishing.

These constructs hold no ambition, need no sustenance, feel no pain, and know no remorse. Most golems are made with a singular purpose in mind; usually as a guardian for a person or a place, or as a construct of war.

***Blind Obedience.*** A golem is created to perform its given task, without fault. If a golem is left without any new instructions, it will continue to follow its current orders to the best of its abilities. If it is unable to do so, it will either remain idle until new orders are given or break down into a violent rampage. It cannot think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no real grasp of language and cannot be tricked or reasoned with.

***Constructed Nature.*** A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Arcane Golem
Arcane golems are hulking constructs, powered by their crystallized arcane core, that are commonly employed as peacekeepers and defenders. Deep grooves are often carved into their outer shell, allowing the energies from their crystal to surge over them in colourful patterns. 

They are highly favoured among blood elves, both for their sturdy build and for their magical resilience. In Quel'thalas, they vigilantly patrol the streets within the city and beyond.

### Harvest Golem
A lumbering figure skulking across the fields, with razor-sharp claws and blazing, orange eyes: that is the visage of the Harvest Golem. These large, terrifying 'scarecrows' sow terror and wreak havoc across the fallow fields of Westfall. Where they came from or who made them still remains a mystery, but it is clear as day that they have been programmed with a single goal in mind â driving the farmers from the land, killing them if necessary. 

Anyone looking to cross Westfall would be wise to stay alert, look out for any odd figures in the distance, and keep clear of the fields after nightfall.

## Grell
A grell is a small, long-armed forest spirit with pointed ears and an accentuated brow. Though they are uncannily similar to imps, a grell is very large by comparison and lack any other features typical for a demon.

Among explorers, researchers, and naturalists, it is speculated that the similarities between grells and imps are not coincidental, and that the first imps were in fact grells fallen to corruption during the first invasion of the Burning Legion. Such theories are widespread, but have never been confirmed nor denied.

***Wild Presence.*** Most grells have skin in shades of green, orange, or brown, mimicking the wilderness where they dwell. Their arms and legs are covered in dense fur, and their hands and feet are all fitted with sharp claws. It is common for grells to fashion themselves simple clothes, as well other adornments -- such as ear and nose-rings.

Some have speculated as to whether these adornments serve a purpose, such as magical foci for casting spells, or if they are just for decoration.

***Fiendish Personality.*** It is said that the grell exist as an ebodiment of the wild, uncanny side of nature, and their personality shows this notion all too well. A grell on its own poses no particular danger, but a gang of grells working together can be a real threat to settlements and communities in their vicinity.

Grells who commit to keeping in a pack like this have been witnessed actively serching for travellers to ambush, overwhelm, and steal from. Though their diet mainly consists of moss, tubers, and mushrooms, it is not unheard of for a grell pack to hunt wild game.

## Harpies
Taking glee in suffering and death, the sadistic harpy is always on the hunt for prey. They are vicious predators, well-know for luring adventures back to their craggy lairs and a certain death.

A harpy combines the body, arms, and head of a night elf with the legs and wings of a hunting bird. Its wicked talons can rip flesh from bone, and its graceful wings lets it soar silently through the air as it hunts for its next kill. It is said that in the eyes of every harpy shines the evil dwelling in their heart.

***Noxious Nests.*** Harpies nest in high-perched, hard-to-reach places, from which they can terrorize their surroundings. A flock of harpies left unchecked may leave destruction in their wake; killing anything they encounter, leaving only their noxious odor in their wake. This stench, a mixture of rotting flesh and mottled feathers, makes it easy to discern the whereabouts of an active nest.

***Precious Collectors.*** These winged humanoids place great value in shiny baubles, ornate trinkets, rare gems, and ores, using them to adorn themselves and their nests. They may be willing to barter and negotiate with travellers and settlements, if there is a chance for them to claim a pretty prize from the ordeal. Whatever calm such trade may instill is never more than a temporary measure, before the harpies take wing to pillage once again.

***Beguiling Creatures.*** Harpies resembles malformed night elves, decked in feathers and given wings. Though they are a repulsive presence, they could be considered quite beautiful from afar -- and only become more beautiful as they grow older, with a strikingly vibrant plumage.

They are incapable of producing male children, as their eggs always hatch females. To this end, their survival relies on their ability to beguile and entrap males from other races, keeping them around until the end of their mating season before killing them off for food.

### Harpy Witch
Some harpies are capable of wielding the forces of nature at their will. These harpy witches are powerful individuals within their nest, with the most powerful exploiting their powers to rise to a near regal status. Keeping any semblence of control in a nest of harpies is a formidable task, driving those who try to extreme measures.

> ##### Variant: Beguiling Harpy
> Some harpies can have a special ability that allows them to charm humanoids.
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting (2/day).*** The harpy's can innately cast *charm person*, requiring no material or somatic components. Its spellcasting modifier is Wisdom.

## Kobolds

Diminutive, rat-like, and subterranean, kobolds can be found dwelling in sprawling caverns and abandoned mines across Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms alike. Even throughout Northrend one can find their aptly named cousins; the snobolds. As far back as the first human settlements in the Eastern Kingdoms, kobolds have been a persistent, and annoying, presence.

Kobolds average at four feet tall, with coarse skin, sharp claws, a pronounced snout, and a spindly tail. Educated guesses have pinned them as a distant offshoot from the troggs, though this has never been proven.

***Skittish Creatures.*** Adventurers who have seen a kobold, especially a kobold away from its pack and lair, can testify for their cowardice. Kobolds are not particularly intelligent, and many consider them more of a nuisance than real danger -- at least in smaller numbers.

***Massive Flocks.*** Kobolds are not only known to bear a resemblance to vermin; they breed like vermin as well. Wherever one kobold can be found, hundreds more are likely not too far behind. While kobolds are rarely threatening smaller numbers, a pack numbering in dozens, even hundreds, can pose a threat even to seasoned adventurers if one were to try and evict them.

They have no concept of marriage. Rather, they form a loose structure of packs and clans based on their lineages, with young individuals opting to migrate between nests and warrens in search of mates outside of their own family.

Famously, a kobold can become very protective of its keepsakes, and they prefer to keep a distance from other races in order to keep themselves safe.

***Candle-Hoarders.*** Despite living deep underground, populating self-made caverns and abandoned mines -- sometimes even chasing miners away if the pack is large enough -- kobolds do not see well in the dark. They rely on candles to traverse whichever caverns they call home. 

These candles are usually made by the kobolds them&shy;selves, twining wicks from their hairs and pulling wax from their ears, though in desperation a kobold may contemplate stealing candles from other nearby settlements. Once a candle has been acquired, it is placed atop the kobold's head and left to burn there.

***Legends of the Darkness.*** Kobold legends speak of a dark, devouring presence dwelling in the deep places of the world, giving reason to the creatures' candle obsession.

To the same end, some kobold packs have been seen keeping rats as pets, as the critters do not fear the dark&shy;ness themselves. A well-trained rat can keep the kobold company and help out with digging, while a not so well-trained rat can make for a good dinner.

### Kobold Names and Language
Kobolds typically speak Low Common, and often adopt other wide-spoken languages in the regions they dwell. The latter is especially prevalent across the Eastern Kingdoms, where most kobold packs and clans have learned Common over their long history of interacting with humans.

Kobold names and clan names are a descriptive amal&shy;gamation of everyday words. Kobold name usually has two parts; a short, easily vocalized first name, and a descriptive surname. Kobold surnames are personal and not inherited, but rather like a title that sums up their character, appear&shy;ance, or a well-known possession of theirs.

Their clan names often refer to common traits passed down through that clan's lineage, or to quirks unique to their society, though they can be hard to distinguish from the names the kobolds give themselves.

## Kodos

A kodo is a giant reptile, known for its thick <br/> hide and characteristics horns. Large and <br/> lumbering, these grazing beasts roam together <br/> in herds, their steps like rolling thunder across <br/> the plains of Kalimdor. Though their strength is <br/> immense, they are peaceful creatures whose horns <br> serve more to defend than to fight.

***Herd Animals.*** Kodos are pack animals, and <br/> show a clear line of authority in their herds. The <br/> head of the pack leads the way, while the rest keep <br/> close guard of the weak and young as to not leave anyone behind. Most kodo herds number in a dozen at the most, though some have been sighted in groups as large as fifty beasts. It is rare for a kodo to wander alone, though some elderly beasts have been seen taking to a life of solitude. 

***Tauren Culture.*** Among the tauren, the kodos have a strong cultural presence as a symbol of vigor and power. Long have they hunted and tamed these imposing beasts, revering these acts important rites of passage for young tauren warriors. And for the size and brawn of the tauren themselves, few beasts can carry them as well as a kodo.

***Pack Beasts.*** Kodos are formidable pack beasts, long elevated as such by the tauren and since ingrained in the Horde as a whole. They can carry even immense loads for long periods of time without any trouble.

If the lizard dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.

## Lashers
Lashers are a family of large, slithering flora, known for their long, appendage-like tendrils and found across most of Azeroth. Though most lashers are not predatory, they will defend themselves if threatened.

***Sentient Plants.*** Their existence is the result of nature magic, seeped down into the ground and left to spread. There, it has given the plants enough will to uproot themselves and roam around. For some lashers, this awakening has been deliberate and fairly harmless. For others, it has transformed the plants into vile monstrosities.

***Widely Adapted.*** With their presence found far and wide, most lashers have found ways to adapt to their surroundings -- be it lush jungles, arid hills, or even barren tundras. They plant their seeds wherever there's magic to sustain them, quickly sprouting into a myriad of tiny creatures before slowly maturing.

***Fast Learners.*** Though they appear driven by little more than instinct, fully mature lashers have shown themselves to be remarkably intelligent. Even capable of laying traps, forming decorations, and converying messages with simple gestures.

### Lasher Spitter
A lasher spitter is a large, carnivorous plant. It produces a strong acid within its stalk, which it then spits out with impressive accuracy through the large maw situated between its petals. The acid is strong enough to dissolve flesh, for easier consumption.

### Barbed Orchid
A barbed orchid stands out from other lashers for its large, vibrant flower-head, centre of which some describe as resembling an owlbeast's beak. Their long tendrils are covered with barbs, which they strike out at prey and intruders alike. 

### Bloodpetal Flayer
At a glance, most would take the bloodpetal flayer for little more than a very colourful lasher. Looks are sure to betray, however; as these lashers are unmatched for their ferocity, and for the potency of the vile toxin kept in their sharp torns. 

> ##### Variant: Mature Lasher
> When lashers reach maturity, some learn to channel the powers of the moon in their favor. 
>
> A mature lashers has the same statistics as a lasher spitter, except that it has a Wisdom score of 12, and replaces the spitter's action options with the following action options
>
> ***Dream Lash.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +3 to hit, range 15/30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d10) radiant damage.

## Leper Gnome
Beneath the snow capped mountains of Dun Morogh lay the halls of Gnomeregan. Once the gnomish capitol, the city's irradiated halls now only swarm with troggs and crazed, addled gnomes. These gnomes, permeating with radiation, have become known as leper gnomes. Their skin has turned a sickly green, dotted with abscesses that burst at the smallest stress or strain.

***A Necessary Sacrifice.*** When the gnomish capitol of Gnomeregan was invaded by troggs, a desperate decision was made when the High Tinker ordered all radioactive waste from the city's numerous machines unleashed. 

Vented through the city in a noxious green gas, and flooded through the pipes in rivers of green goop, the attempt to cull their invaders ultimately killed off more gnomes than troggs -- and left the city a radioactive wasteland, riddled with danger.

Worse yet, as the city's ruins were later explored, it became clear how many had survived the ordeal; all of them mutated and driven mad by the city's green haze.

***Hostile Insanity.*** Fractious at best, the leper gnomes have continued their life in Gnomeregan as though all is as it once was. Their minds warped by toxic fumes, most leper gnomes do not seem grasp the reality of their situation. Most dangerous are the few that do.

Still sharing the city with their trogg invaders, leper gnomes are known to be extremely paranoid and prone to immediate hostility toward any who would come looking for them. After all, anyone they don't know could suddenly turn out to be in tow with the troggs.

***Mutated Creatures.*** Once the radiation takes hold in a creature, as witnessed with the leper gnomes, it slowly warps into something else; gradually tearing it apart until little more is left than a mindless puddle of toxic sludge. With the time the leper gnomes have spent below the earth, in Gnomeregan, some unfortunate few have already twisted and devolved into monstrous aberrations.

<div style='margin-top:27px;'></div>

> ##### Radiation Disease
> When an uninfected creature comes into contact with a source of radiation â such as contaminated water, being bitten by an infected creature, or for every hour spent in a high-radiation area â the creature must succeed on a DC 11 a Constitution saving throw or contract the radiation disease.
>
> It takes 1d4 days for the disease to manifest. As it does, the creature's skin takes on a sickly green tint and abscesses start to spread across its surface. At the end of that period, the creature gains advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance against poison damage. However, the creature also has disadvantage on all Strength and Dexterity ability checks, as well as weapon attack rolls.
>
> Once a creature has carried the radiation disease for more than two weeks, its skin turns completely green. It no longer suffers from disadvantage on ability checks or weapon attacks, but it gains an indefinite madness as described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* (p. 260).
>
> The radiation symptoms can be cured by a spell, such as *lesser restoration*. Once the disease has manifested, a more potent spell such as *greater restoration* or *heal* is required.

## Makrura
A makrura is a large aquatic creature found living in small colonies along Azeroth's numerous coastlines and deep oceans. They resemble enormous crayfish, some near six feet tall, to which some call them *lobster men*.

***Aggressive and Hostile.*** Makruras within the confines of their colony are immediately hostile toward intruders, and will attack anyone who dare approach. With their massive claws, they pinch and pin their target down, before subsequently tearing it into tiny pieces.

***Wrecked Colonies.*** With their homes often situated in turbulent waters or along contested shorelines, it is not uncommon for a colony to seek seclusion by taking shelter inside wrecked ships or underwater caverns.

***Savory Prey.*** Makrura meat is a delicacy, tried and tested, for many races both above and beneath the ocean. Some towns and villages may try to turn a nearby colony into a hunting opportunity, though the most prominent enemy of the makrura are murlocs and nagas.

### Makrura Tidecaller
Some Makrura have an innate affinity for water magic, able to summon its powers at will. These notorious mystics are known as tidecallers; often wise sages in their colonies, they bring forth the tides both to heal and to harm.

## Mana Wyrms
Manifesting near pockets of arcane energy, mana wyrms are, as the name implies, serpent-like creatures that shimmer with arcane energy. 

Their bodies are translucent, hovering above the ground as though they are swimming through the air. More a nuisance than a threat, they rarely pose much concern for seasoned adventurers who happen by them.

***Unstable Temperament.*** The temperament of a mana wyrm hangs solely on how long itâs been since it last fed. Though they are considered fairly harmless, an agitated wyrm can very quickly turn aggressive. If threatened, they are known to explode in a flash of arcane energy.

***Arcane Sense.*** A mana wyrms can sense the presence of arcane energy around it, and will gravitate toward its source. If the source is a creature and the wyrm is hungry, it may attempt to attack the creature accordingly. 

### Arcane Wyrm
An arcane wyrm is in many ways similar to a mana wyrm, though it is much, much larger, slowly snaking their way through the air near arcane fonts. 

Some have attributed their existence to them simply being left to feed on too much energy, though their temperament is still calm and even so long as they not directly threatened.

## Mechanicals
Mechanical constructs distinguish themselves from organic creatures mainly for their lack of blood, internal organs, and natural instincts. Instead, gears whirr and circuits spark inside these mobile machinations. 

Some act only at the behest of whoever holds the remote, while others automatically carry out their given set of pre-configured instructions. Some mechanicals distinguish themselves even further, possessing instructions so meticulously crafted as to resemble genuine intelligence. 

As they are wholly driven by the logic of their instructions, mechanical constructs do not possess the ability to give any emotional response: they cannot be charmed, and they certainly cannot be frightened.

***Titanic Legacy.*** The origin of Azeroth's great mechanical achievements can be traced back to the titanic Watchers and the ordering of Azeroth. There, the titanic Keeper Mimiron oversaw the creation of a race of diminutive clockwork humanoids -- mechagnomes, forerunners of the gnomes -- as well as a number of other mechanical creations that have since stood the test of time.

***Gnomish and Goblin Ingenuity.*** Alongside the legacy of the gnomes, instinctly carrying on the work of their titanic creator, another point of technolgical innova&shy;tion across Azeroth has been the artifically enhanced ingenuity of the goblins. Unlike the gnomes, however, goblin creations have a dentency to be remarkably destructive.

The two races lead a contested field of engineering, and have overseen countless mechanical wonders and mishaps across the years -- including cities, transportation systems, explosive automatons, and giant death rays.

### Mechanical Animal Template
A mechanical animal is any Huge or smaller construct created by a skilled engineer to mimic a beast of the same size. The following characteristics change or are added to a creature when a mechanical version is created.

***Retained Characteristics.*** The mechanical animal retains its Armor Class, hit points, Hit Dice, Speed, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, vulnerabilities, resis&shy;tances, immunities, and special traits.

***Lost Characteristics.*** The mechanical animal loses its original saving throw and skill bonuses, and special sense. It loses any action that isn't Multiattack or a melee weapon attack that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. If it has an action or a melee weapon attack that deals some other type of damage, it loses the ability to deal damage of that type, unless the damage comes from a piece of equipment, such as a magic item.

***Type.*** The mechanical animal's type is construct, and it loses any tags it might have had.

***Alignment.*** The mechanical animal is unaligned.

***Ability Scores.*** The mechanical animal's ability scores change as follows: Int 3 (-4), Wis 11 (+0), Cha 1 (-5).

***Senses.*** The mechanical animal has 60 feet darkvision.

***Condition Immunities.*** The mechanical animal can't be charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, or gain exhaustion levels.

***Languages.*** The mechanical animal loses all languages it might've known, and understand the languages of its creator, but can't speak.

### Alarm-o-Bot
These constructs are, as the name suggests, walking alarms. Envisioned by gnomes as a safeguard against threats hiding in the dark, rugged terrain of their homeland, the alarm-o-bot keeps a constant watch for sights, sounds, and more with its numerous sensors. If there's a presence it cannot confirm to be friendly, it blares out a high-pitched warning that danger is afoot.

### Bombling
An old goblin classic, the bombling -- or bomb bot -- is a small set of legs and a pair of eyes designed to carry an explosive charge on its back. It can be primed both to a specific target and to a general swathe of targets, which it will then try to chase down. Once it gets close enough, it detonates.

### Crowd Pummeler
A mechanical design adopted by both goblins and gnomes, crowd pummelers take the form of a tall, bipedal construct loaded with weapons. Its name is not coincidental, as it is often used as cheap throw-away sentries; programmable with a set of laws and regulations, alongside a chief directive to pummel any perpetrators.

### Mechano-Tank
The Mechano-tank, or spider tank, is a gnomish construct best known for its armoured chassis and spider-like design. Built for close quarters, the tanks are reinforced to withstand the elements and fined-tuned for maximum destruction. Their legs are able to contract and release, allowing the tank to launch forward into combat.

> ***Crowd Pummel (Recharge 6).*** The pummeler slams its claws into the ground. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed saving throw, the target is knocked prone.

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

> ##### Variant: Arcane Nullifier
> An arcane nullifier has a challenge rating of 4 (1,100 XP). It has the same statistics as a crowd pummeler except that it replaces the pummeler's action options with the following action options.
> <div style='margin-top:5px;'></div>

>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
>
> ***Slow (Recharge 5-6).*** The nullifier targets one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The creature must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The effect lasts for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
>
> ***Nullify (Recharge after a Long Rest).*** The nullifier attempts to dispel all magical effects within 30 feet of it, as if it had cast the *dispel magic* as a 3rd-level spell on everything within range.
> <div style='margin-top:5px;'></div>
>
> The nullifier also gains the following reaction.
> <div style='margin-top:5px;'></div>
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Reflection Field.*** When a creature hits the nullifier with a ranged spell attack, the nullifier can reflect the spell onto a target within 15 feet of it.

> ##### Crewing a Mechano-tank
> Most mechano-tanks are manual machines that require a pilot to operate, and even autopiloted tanks can be overwritten to work manually for a time.
>
> A creature can use its action to attempt to climb a **piloted** mechano-tank by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failed save, the creature expends half its movement and is unable to climb the mechano-tank.
>
> The controls of the mechano-tank is sealed tight behind a hatch. The hatch can be opened with a successful DC 20 Strength check, or broken if dealt 20 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, it has an Armor Class (AC 15).
>
> A Small or smaller creature can expend 5 feet of movement to enter an unoccupied mechano-tank. A creature unfamiliar with the controls of tank must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence check to under&shy;stand the controls of the machine before it is able to pilot it and control its actions and movement.
>
> While piloted, the mechano-tanks Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are exchanged with those of the pilot. A piloted tank uses the initiative of its pilot. The pilot must use its action, reaction, and movement to use the machines action options or force it to move to a new location. While a crea&shy;ture is crewing the mechano-tank, it is considered to have full cover against any attack made against it from the ground.
>
> Taking control of an **autopiloted** tank requires a successful DC 17 Tinker's Tool Intelligence check. On a successful save, the creature takes control of the tank until the end of the creature's next turn. At which point the shredderâs failsafe mechanisms return, requiring a new save to temporarily take control of it.

## Murloc
From a distance, the degenerate and fishlike murlocs might not seem like much of a threat, but the small creatures are rarely cornered alone. They rarely venture far from their waters, and never too far from their tribe. Though they might seem humorous for their ways, behind their blank expressions hides a murderous mind.

***Strange Territories.*** Murlocs populate coastlines, lake&shy;shores and swamps, and prefer to keep within their territory. A murloc tribe on the move is often one looking for a new place to settle -- and settled they certainly have, in nearly every corner of Azeroth.

They build their chaotic villages out of mud-and-twig huts, resembling structures more suited for life underwater than life along the shore. There's no orderly pattern to where a murloc would build its home, though the tribe's oracle and strongest fighters tend to claim the best spots.

***Questionable Intelligence.*** Most would argue that murlocs are not very intelligent, considering their simple lives and near-indecipherable language.

Still, they are ferocious hunters and zealous in their faith. There does not appear to be any singular belief to which the murlocs keep. Instead, they follow the whim of what signs they read from the elements, and occasionally the will of other aquatic entities -- including nagas.

***Pack Hunters.*** Though murlocs are not particularly brave, they will attempt to hunt foes that they can outnumber. In doing so, they lead just a few murlocs ahead to trick their quarry into giving chase, often into murky waters if they can. There, the brunt of the tribe's hunters lay in wait, leaping into the fray like a swarm of hungry fish.

### Murloc Tidehunter
While most murlocs know to wield a blade or a spear, some select few have harnessed an aptitude for bringing finer tools to the hunt. The tidehunters weave and keep their own nets, sharing techniques for heavy weights and barbed hooks within their hunting parties. A group of tidehunters on the prowl can be a serious threat to anyone foolish enough to pass through their territory.

### Murloc Oracle
A few select murlocs are elevated above the rest of their tribe, born to a strong will and a natural affinity for magic. These murlocs, known as oracles, are adept spellcasters. They are masters of the elements and can use them to control the environment around their enemies.

### Murloc Names and Language
The murlocs' native tongue is Nerglish; a strange, aquatic language in similar lieu to Low Common, which they share with a handful of other creatures.

Their names, just like their language, are wet and soft-sounding. They don't keep individual surnames, but rather take ot their name of their tribe -- which in turn recalls the tribe's deeds, appearance, history, or tradition.

## Nagas
The naga are former Highborne night elves, transformed into a race of horrifying sea serpents.

During the Great Sundering, when the Kaldorei city of Zin-Azshari was destroyed, the Kaldorei Queen Azshara and many of her Highborne followers fell into the depths of the Great Sea. Unwilling to face death, Azshara forged a pact with an Old God, N'Zoth, which saw her and her followers twisted into serpentine aberrations.

Most naga who remain belong to either of two groups: those who followed the betrayer, Illidan Stormrage, to find a new home on the shattered world of Outland; and those still loyal to Queen Azshara and her plan to reclaim the surface of Azeroth.

***Mystical Culture.*** Naga culture is a complex, multi&shy;faceted affair. The distinction between male and female naga saturates everything from their appearance to their perceived place in society.

Male naga are large and muscular creatures, some of them growing to be veritable behemoths with the strength to tear down walls with their bare hands. Most serve as soldiers and guardians, while some hold power as cruel taskmasters or as warlords on the battlefield.

Female naga are more delicate, though ruthlessly cunning and intellectually superior. They are natural spellcasters, and hone their skills to great extent in order to sunder their foes. Naga society is inherently matriarchal, favouring female leaders in zealous homage to their Highborne queen.

***Azshara's Followers.*** The naga revere their Queen, the mighty Azshara. To them, she is a living demigod in both power and stature, and all they do is by her design.

Factions of naga work tirelessly in their bid for power, seeking the Queen's blessing. To this end, there are few limits to how far they will go to earn her favour -- even at the cost of their own lives.

### Naga Myrmidon
The myrmidons, with their navy blue skin and fearsome tridents, are among the strongest among naga warriors. They are feared by all who dwell near the sea; though most prominently by the makrura.

They are often the most fanatical in their loyalty to the Queen. So much so that some would never take to their orders with anything other than utmost obedience.

### Naga Sea Witch
"Sea witch" is the informal term for a naga priestess. Many have witnessed the prodigious storm that mark their presence, but few have actually seen the witch herself and since lived to tell the tale.

They are potent spellcasters, able to use terrifying frost and lightning spells against their foes, as well as their Highborne legacy of the arcane for personal protection.

### Naga War Lord
Naga war lords are male naga warriors with shells and stone-like carapace fused to their skin, entirely covering their head and most of their upper body.

Their right arm has taken on the appearance of a large hermit crab, though it is unknown whether this is an inherent mutation or a deliberate choice.

### Naga Brute
Naga brutes are massive, lumbering beasts, strong enough to stand as siege weapons for the naga army. Some carry rank and title, while others act like little more than beasts.

Whichever is the case for a particular brute, they are not avoid of intelligence. They follow given orders to the best of their abilities, and know well enough to strategize their way around an obvious trap when they see one.

> ***Crashing Wave (Recharges 5-6).*** The naga charges forward creating a wave of water that crashes anyone on its path. The naga moves 20 feet forward in a straight line producing a wave 20 feet long, 10 feet tall and 10 feet wide . Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (5d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. 
>
> ***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the naga can utter a special command or warning whenever a non-hostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the naga. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the naga is incapacitated.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Parry.*** The naga adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the naga must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Ogres
Ogres are large, brutish humanoids of immense strength. Though native to the crumbling world of Draenor, many ogres have since settled as independent clans on Azeroth. The average adult ogre stands between 9 and 10 feet tall, weighing in at almost a thousand pounds.

As far as the ogre is concerned, size is paramount. They eschew any attempt to cover themselves up, keeping their clothing simple, while brandishing fearsome warpaints.

***Distant Settlements.*** Following the Horde's second failure to invade Azeroth, the ogre clans that had come with them from Draenor quickly dispersed.

Each clean headed in their own direction. Some sought to return back home, while most were content to stake a claim in this new world. Since then, ogres have settled across the world; from the hills of Arathi and the cape of Stranglethorn, to the lush reaches of Feralas.

***Clan Culture.*** Within ogre clans, it is the strongest that stand in highest regard. An immense show of force is the fastest way to rise, though also the fastest way to fall <br/> at the hands of any enemies made along the way.

Still, for as highly as the ogres regard their <br/> strength, the powerful and keen-minded ogre <br/> magi are often the real presence of power <br/> within their clan. Whether acting as the right <br/> hand of an ogre lord, or as the clan leader <br/> directly, they are the ones pulling the strings.

***Brutish Combatants.*** For an ogre, the best <br/> solution is often the simplest one. When engaged <br/> in a fight, it is not uncommon for the ogre to risk <br/> even deadly harm if thinks it can push through and <br/> come out on top by sheer virtue of strength.

They are vicious opponents, strong enough to rend limb from limb with their bare hands, and crush skulls with their spiked clubs and stone-hewn mauls.

### Ogre Magi
The ogre magi, with its two heads, holds an intelligence far exceeding the rest of its kin. Borne of the same magic that they wield, it was not uncommon for the Horde -- in its second invasion of Azeroth -- to force this transformation in order to bolster its rank of spellcasters.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the two heads are not always in agreement, they are paramount to the ogre's magical aptitude. A living proof that having two heads can be better than having one.

### Ogre Lord
Ogre lords are massive, hulking figures, towering above their clan in both size and status. While they have no aptitude for magic and little thought for intricate plans, their imposing presence precedes them well enough to keep the rest of their clan in check.

Many might try to challenge an ogre lord's power over the course of its heavy-handed rule, though for most of them this confrontation doesn't end well.

## Owlbeasts
The owlbeasts are serene and powerful creatures, <br/> inhabiting many forested regions across Azeroth. <br>They resemble a cross between a bear and an owl, <br>suited with the antlers of a great stag and the massive, <br/>hooked beak of a bird of prey. 

With their lumbering build and remarkably strong claws, they might seem like fearsome predators. However, their looks betray them for the gentle creatures they really are -- at least when they are left well alone.

***Forest Settlements.*** Owlbeasts keep to dense forests, finding shelter to build nests between rocks and inside caves. They are social creatures at heart, living harmoni&shy;ously with their fellows in small colonies, not keeping to any apparent structure of leadership.

From time to time, their choice of settlement may bring them into close contact with another race. For the most part, this is not a problem, as the creatures have been seen thriving in the company of night elves and tauren.

Other times, it may force them to fight for their claim or move on to somewhere else. Once first provoked, they are quick to enrage -- at which point all hope for reason may well be lost.

***Peaceful Creatures.*** Travellers with the care to show respect are seldom hard-pressed to find aid from these gentle giants; whether they're seeking help, or a safe passage out of the woods. Still, if one does opt to disregard the owlbeasts or meet them with hostile intent, they are rarely ever shy to respond in kind.

***Children of Elune.*** The goddess Elune first created the Owlbeasts in ages past, joining the strength of the bear with the wisdom of the owl, to serve as guardians for the demigod Cenarius. Though blessed by the moon, some have fallen stray from their path, lost and confused without the guidance of their goddess.

***Corruptible Minds.*** Owlbeasts are, as with most wild beings on Azeroth, susceptible to corruption. Whether by fel energies or nightmarish whispers, it only takes so much to tip the scales and turn these docile beings into ferocious monsters. Such flocks are eventually sought out by druids seeking to intervene, though there is no telling what chaos they might have wrought in the meantime.

### Moonkin
Though all owlbeasts are children of Elune, few keep their blessing closer to heart than the graceful moonkin. The two may seem near indistinguishable at first, but the moonkin's heightened mind leaves it more than capable for coherent dialogue and rational thought.

Bound to their groves and keeping in druidic circles, to whom they act as guardians, the boast a formidable breadth of magical power.

## <span style="margin-left:95px"></span> Quilboars
<span style="margin-left:110px"></span> A ferocious, suicidally brave race, quil- 
<span style="margin-left:115px"></span> boars are renowned for their stubby, 
<span style="margin-left:125px"></span> pig-like appearance. Rows of sharp 
<span style="margin-left:130px"></span> spines run down their hunched 
<span style="margin-left:125px"></span> backs, and stubby tusks protrude 
<span style="margin-left:110px"></span> from their mouth.

<span style="margin-left:40px"></span> They adorn their skin with tribal markings and tattoos, and their devotion to their tribe may seem almost alien to most other races.

***Sacred Settlements.*** Quilboars live in the protective shade of enormous bramble roots, so large that they choke the land of all other life. These thorny landscapes, believed to have first grown from the blood of the ancient guardian Agamaggan, are considered sacred to the quilboars.

Should the land become too barren for even them, they are quick to tear down and move on. Once a tribe finds a new place to settle, its mighty thornweavers seed and grow forth new roots for them to live in.

***Hostile Colonies.*** Within their thorny settlements, a quilboar tribe can grow impressively large. Loyalty to the tribe is paramount for its survival, to which they train their young quickly to meet any outsiders with hostility.

***Ancient Powers.*** Quilboars practice a crude form of shamanism, with the blessing of Agamaggan. These shamans, known as thornweavers, are kept in high regard by their tribes as the voice of their ancient guardian.

They revere Agamaggan, the great boar, as their creator. By making offerings in his name, a tribe's fighters can summon forth terrifying strength as they descend upon their foes.

### Quilboar Packmaster
With their natural bond to the great boar, some quilboars have have made it their lives to raise and fight alongside such creatures. A packmaster rarely walks alone, always taking one or more boars in its company.

### Quilboar Thornweaver
The thornweavers are vital to a quilboar tribe's survival, as these wise shamans bring forth the thorny brambles in which the tribe makes its home. Even the tribe's chieftain knows well to respect the word of a thornweaver. By their bond, they are the voice of Agamaggan.

### Quilboar Chieftain
At the head of the quilboar tribe sits its chieftain. In most cases, the rise of a tribe's chieftain came at the demise of its last. They surround themselves with their thornweavers for guidance, and sometimes wield a host of battleguards at their side.

### Quilboar Names and Language
The quilboar language is a rough, sharp-spoken tongue that relies on a mixture of guttural sounds and sharp squeals. There is little room for eloquence in their vocabulary, though it is by no means primitive.

Their names follow a mixture of native descriptions and short words, and their names lead descriptive, evocative titles -- for which rough translations in other languages often become the most widely known.

## Ravagers
Native to the world of Draenor, these quadrupedal beings roam across their surrounding land in search of food to fill their insatiable appetite, ready to hound down and tear apart any creature made of flesh.

Ravagers resemble giant insectiods, equipped with ragged teeth and a voracious lust for meat. Their bodies are covered in hard chitin, which combined with their impressive speed make them amicable fighters.

***Ferocious Carnivores.*** Being such fierce predators, ravagers hunt together in swarms. They hide behind rocks and within crevices, waiting for their quarry to come within reach. Then, as soon as the moment comes, lunge out from hiding and rush into the fray with overwhelming force.

***Swarm Mentality.*** Perhaps not too surprising, given their insect-like appearance, are the ever-growing ravager colonies. Though their hive mind is not as intrinsically linked as some others, it still binds the colony together as a large, fiercely protective swarm.

***Migrated Creatures.*** Ravagers are native to the world of Draenor, with no true equal on Azeroth -- save for one small colony, locked away on the Exodar with the fleeing Draenei.

The ship's subsequent crash off the northern coast of Kalimdor saw this particular group of ravagers released into the wild. Most were stopped in their tracks, though some may yet have escaped to flee deeper into the thickets, or across the waters to the mainland.

### Ravager Brood Mother
At the heart of a ravager colony sits its queen; the brood mother. She grants the colony life, by laying the eggs that hatches into the ravager larva. For her vital part in keeping the colony alive, other ravagers in the colony will go to extreme lengths to ensure her safety.

### Ravager Wasp
Following the birth of a ravager larva, the creature quickly cocoons itself in order to grow further. From the cocoon, the ravager emerges as a slender wasp with a ferocious sting. The ravager wasp gorges itself on its prey, feeding until its wings can no longer support the weight of its body. Then, its wings are shed; as the wasp undergoes one final metamorphosis into a full-grown, four-legged ravager.

> ##### Ravagers on alternate Draenor
> The ravagers of alternate Draenor were never exposed to the powers of fel, their bodies were not malformed. These creatures have evolved into large monsters more resembling four-legged spiders, their wings have grown with them giving all ravagers a flying speed equal to their normal speed.

## Sabercats
Sabercats are cunning felines that prowl across <br> Azeroth in their hunt for prey. These large, proud, and magnificent felines have become companions for many adventurers -- and the demise of even more. They are intelligent and loyal creatures when domesticated, but <br> feral and quite aggressive in the wilds.

***Stalkers of Azeroth.*** Sabercats can be found throughout Azeroth, however, the vast majority of their kind is spread through the regions of Kalimdor. These feline creatures have adjusted to the climate around them, sprouting pelts able to camouflage them into their surroundings.

Many species of sabercats exist, each have adapted to their climate differently and act differently towards out&shy;siders. Of the many species, the most common sabercats are: dreadsabers, frostsabers, and nightsabers.

***Supreme Predators.*** Sabercats are deadly predators that display the pinnacle prowess of a stalking hunter, able to prowl up on their prey with ease and even avert the gaze of even perceptive and watchful individuals.

Sabercats are also pack animals and they rarely hunt alone and even if a creature manages to notice a sabercat prowling up on them, another may already be ready to pounce onto the creature from behind.

***Fierce Companion.*** Night elves have bred and trained sabercats as mounts for their army for thousands of years. Once domesticated or fully trained from a cub, the feline beasts are loyal to a fault and become life-long companions. They are agile mounts able to traverse most terrain with ease, and become fierce fighters when combat emerges.

### Manasaber
Manasabers are sabercats that have been locked away with the night elves of Suramar, the well of power within the city of Suramar infused the sabercats with mana and changed them from simple sabercats into magical beasts.

Most manasabers are domesticated animals, having lived in tight proximity with the night elves of Suramar who trained and used the sabers within their tight borders.

<div style='margin-top:35px;'></div>

> ##### Variant: Sabercat Armor
> An armored sabercat has an AC based on the type of barding worn (see the *Player's Handbook* for more information on barding). The sabercat's AC includes its Dexterity modifier, where applicable. Barding doesn't alter the sabercat's challenge rating.

## Satyrs
An ancient curse afflicting a highborne sorcerer would create the first satyr and other would soon follow. These demonic beings were once night elves of the Kaldorei Empire, but little of that heritage remains in their twisted bodies, now there's only anger and hatred towards all.

***Cursed Affliction.*** During the War of the Ancients, the Highborne sorcerer Xavius was tasked with opening a portal that connected Azeroth to the Twisting Nether, a task he would fail in accomplishing and as a punishment for his failure, Sargaras would torture his disembodied spirit. However, the Lord of the Burning Legion still saw use in Xavious and would create for him a ned body, the demonic body of the first satyr.

The satyr Xavius was sent back to Azeroth to spread his cursed existence through the Kaldorei Empire, twisting and reshaping night elves into the demonic satyur race. Like Xavius himself, all the satyrs he created was capable of passing on their curse to others, and the satyr curse would continue to spread through the ages to night elves and denizens of other races as well. Although it has grown weaker and less effective over time.

***Created Not Born.*** Although both male and female satyrs exist, they have never been able to reproduce. Thus all satyrs in existence have been created by being afflicted with the satyr curse. Even though few new satyr are created, they continue to be an imminent threat to Azeroth.

***Burning Hatred.*** Satyrs are creatured of hatred; they were created out of hate and gained that quality from their creator. They have a burning hatred for all other living creatures, however, nothing surpasses the hate they show for their old night elven kin. Satyrs are immediately hostile towards outsiders and will attempt to manipulate or corrupt them if possible.

***Tainted Magic.*** These demonic beings corrupt the land they walk on and drain it of magic as if they were wielding the powerful fel itself, they leech onto purity and drain it of power for their own nefarious needs.

All the power they drain is stored in their hooves, and perceptive creatures are able to distinguish a truly power&shy;full satyr from the rest by its swollen hooves.

***Frightful Fighters.*** Satyrs are not known for forming an organized army with a strategy or plan. They live in small and remote sects and when a sentry sounds danger, every satyr in the sect is quick to throw themselves into battle without worrying for their own lives. They act like a horde of demons without a commander whose orders to follow.

### Satyr Trickster
Certain satyrs show a penchant for laying painful traps and ambushing their targets. These tricksters revere and mimic their Lord, Xavius' abilities of manipulation and take subtle approaches when the horn of battle sounds. By sneaking up on their enemies they are able to take out the strongest target of the assault.

### Satyr Hellcaller
Satyrs who revel in  fel magic are called hellcallers, these warlocks are larger and more imposing than common satyrs as the magic they have drained bolster their physical form. They make powerful warlocks who wield fel and shadow with an equally destructive will.

## Scourge
Free of the demonic masters that created them, the pre&shy;cursor of the Burning Legions invasion into Azeroth have gained a will of their own. Under the rule of the dreaded Lich King, the Scourge built themselves up on the arctic continent of Northrend, spreading their influence through&shy;out the continent and beyond.

The Scourge consists of terrifying and destructive crea&shy;tures, creatures resurrected into undeath by necromancers devoted to the Lich King, their forms twisted into undead abominations raised for their dark lord's service. From the icy peak of Northrend the Lich King rules uncontested as he unleashes his undead scourge on the world.

***The Lich King.*** In his attempt to escape the shattering world of Draenor, the old shaman Ner'zhul was appre&shy;hended by the demon lord Kil'jaeden. He tore the shaman's body apart, but kept his spirit intact and aware. Kil'jaeden offered Ner'zhul his last chance to serve the Burning Legion, an offer the orc could not deny. Kil'jaeden trapped his spirit within a the Helm of Domination and incased him in block of ice. Thus the Lich King was born.

Encased in a block of ice the Lich King was sent to Azeroth, landing in the frozen wastelands of Northrend. Here, the spectral being of unfathomable power would begin the formation of the Undead Scourge. From his frozen throne, the Lich King extended his will across the land to form his Undead Scourge, ever mindful of deceivers schemes as he in secret sought a way out of his icy prison.

In his secret search for an escape, his attention would eventually be drawn to the prince of Lordaeron, Arthas Menethil. A capable warrior who had taken up arms against the seemingly endless assaults of the Lich Kings Scourge. Arthas grew increasingly restless as he pushed back against the Scourge, eventually tracking the origin of its plague to Northrend. Intend on ending its threat of the Scourge forever he took up the cursed runeblade Frost&shy;mourne. Though the sword did grant him great power, the cost would be high as Arthas began to lose his soul, eventually completing unholy transformation to a death knight as his soul slipped away. He became Ner'zhuls champion and would be a fearful warrior leading the Scourge through its rampage at the Lich Kings command. 

After countless battles, the demise of great and powerful individuals, leaders of kingdoms and commanders of the Burning Legion. Arthas would travel to Northrend and enter the hollow glacier that had become the Frozen Throne. With a cry of strength, Arthas would strike through the Lick Kings icy prison and pick up the Helm of Domina&shy;tion. As he placed Ner'zhuls thorny helm on his head, their spirits would fuse into a single mighty being, just as the Lich King had always planned. And thus one of the most powerful entities on Azeroth would be created.

***Plague of Undeath.*** Ner'zhul was tasked with creating an army, a vanguard for the invasion of the Burning Legion. For that he conjured the plague of undeath, a magical affliction that would spread across Lordaeron as a disease. Killing any afflicted and causing them to rise once more under his influence. The plague was aimed at humanoids, but it would afflict much more than that. It would affect flora and fauna with strange symptoms of the plague, but rarely imminent death.

Since first conjured by Ner'zhul the plague has lingered in regions of Lordaeron, creating the plaguelands them&shy;selves. In the years following its use, others have attempted to use the plague of undeath as a weapon for their own benefit, some even tried to recreate its effects themselves.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***The Frozen Throne.*** The Icecrown Citadel dominates Northrend, visible from farther away than nearly any other structure. It is the home to the greatest army of undead in the known world. Atop its glacial core dwells the Lich King, emitting his will across Azeroth to the commanders of the Scourge under his influence.

### Abomination
Twisted, mutilated creatures comprised of multiple dead limbs and body parts from different corpses. Abominations are not risen like so many other undead, they a created. Constructed out of putrid flesh, loosely stitched together to create enormous rotting masses of meat. They are fearless creatures that takes joy in carving the flesh from the bones of their quarry and lustfully eating it as a delightful meal.

### Gargoyle
Unlike most creatures of the Undead Scourge, Gargoyles are not undead. These strange, wiry flyers are known for their rough, crystaline hides that protects them from all manner of attacks. Native to Northrend, gargoyles were brought to Lordaeron at Arthas' command as scouts in the army of the Scourge. Chaotic by nature, they have proven effective in their task and a frightful aerial combatant.

### Ghoul
Ravenous cannibals that leave only havoc and devoured corpses behind them. Ghouls are lumbering creatures of once innocent humans transformed into rotting corpses with a lust for flesh and terror.

They are a weapon of panic for the Scourge, a mindless vanguard meant to terrorize settlements before the forces of the Scourge arrive. Made for the sole purpose of striking terror and doubt in settlements as they feast on the dead and living, friend and foe alike.

> ##### Variant: Greater Abomination
> A greater abomination has a challenge rating of 9 (5,000 XP). It has the statistics of an abomination except that it has 152 (16d10 + 62) hit points, Armor Class (AC 17), +10 to hit with its weapon attacks, and gains the following action options.
>
>***Engorge.*** The abomination makes one cleaver attack and places a grappled target in its ribcage. The target becomes restrained, and can use its action to break free by succeeding on a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. While restrained in this way, a creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the abominations turns. An abomination can have only one creature restrained within its ribcage.
>
> ***Cannibalize.*** The abomination cannibalize the corpse of creature that has been dead for less than 24 hours. Each creature of the abomination's choice that is within 120 feet and can see it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the abomination's Cannibalize for the next 24 hours.

> ##### Crewing a Shredder
> Most shredders are manual machines that require a pilot to operate, and even autopiloted shredders can be overwritten to work manually for a time.
>
> A creature can use its action to attempt to climb a **piloted** shredder by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failed save, the creature expends half its movement and is unable to climb the shredder.
>
> A Medium or smaller creature can expend 5 feet of movement to enter an unoccupied shredder. A creature unfamiliar with the controls of shredders must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence check to understand the controls of the machine before it is able to pilot it and control its actions and movement.
>
> While piloted, the shredders Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are exchanged with those of the pilot. A piloted shredder uses the initiative of its pilot. The pilot must use its action, reaction, and movement to use the machines action options or force it to move to a new location. While a creature is crewing the shredder, it is considered to have three-quarters cover against any attack made against it from the ground.
>
> Taking control of an **autopiloted** shredder requires a successful DC 14 Tinker's Tool Intelligence check. On a successful save, the creature takes control of the shredder until the end of the creature's next turn. At which point the shredderâs  failsafe mechanisms return, requiring a new save to temporarily take control of it.

## Silithids
Silithids are frightful insectoids that lives in large colonies excavated beneath Azeroth. Although the insects individual strength is questionable at best, the colony's collective hive-mind can send warnings and pain surging through the hive to alert the silithids of the intruders.

Silithid can range drastically in size, beginning their life as small insignificant larva and growing into the swarms of insectoids that make up their colonies. Whatever their size may be, they all resemble massive insects. If those insects had mutated and desperately wanted to eat you.

***Spawns of Qiraji.*** As the kingdon of the aqir was left in ruins, those who remained would split in two and venture in opposite directions. One grouped traveled as far south as south goes and ransacked the research station near Uldum. Converting the titan facility into an extensive hive, renamed themselves the qiraji and their new home Ahn'Qiraj.

But their new hive held a dark secret, the facility had served as the prison of C'Thun, one of the Old Gods who had once reigned over primordial Azeroth. The arrival of the qiraji turned the facility from a prison into a seat of power. Worshiping the Old God as the aqirs had before them, the qiraji would become his servants and spent thousands of years building an army capable of exacting revenge upon the whole of Kalimdor.

To form this army C'Thun would create the silithid, a race of insectiod creatures born from the qiraji themselves. The silithid would grow and become an enormous force for Ahn'Qiraj to utilize as they  created their great empire.

***Bestial Drones.*** Unlike the qiraji, silithids aren't sentient beings. C'Thun created them to be mindless servants of the qiraji, minions that would be eternally loyal to the rulers of Ahn'qiraj and in turn to C'Thun himself.

<div style='margin-top:733px;'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Collective Hive-Mind.*** Although silithids might seem to be acting of their own accord, they are not sentient beings and work as a collective entity in their hive. This does not however make them any less dangerous. A hive of silithids are often controlled by one or more colossi exerting their will over the collective hive and directing their way of life.

The hive colossi's are in turn controlled by the powerful qiraji who exert complete dominance over the race shaped from their own beings. It is not uncommon for large hives to have a strange crystalline prism deep within its core for the qiraji to directly communicate orders through.

***Adaptable Hive.*** No other creature can adapt to changes in their environment as quickly as the silithid. Adventurers foolish enough to delve into the heart of a silithid hive in hopes of removing its colossi might think that they've killed its mind and hampered the colony, however, the its larva are able to evolve into a variety of shapes and sizes based on the colony's needs, replenishing any loss.

## Skeletons
Skeletons arise when animated by dark magic. They heed the summons of necromancers who call them from their stony tombs and ancient battlefields, or rise of their own accord in places saturated with death and loss, awakened by stirrings of necromancy or presence of corrupting evil.

***Animated Dead.*** Whatever sinister force awakens a skeleton infuses its bones with a dark vitality, adhering joint to joint and reassembling limbs. This energy motivates <br> a skeleton to move and think in a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. Resurrecting a skeleton restores its body and soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empowers it.

While most skeletons are the animated remains of dead humans and other humanoids, skeletal undead can be created from the bones of other creatures besides human&shy;oids, giving rise to a host of terrifying and unique forms.

***Obedient Servants.*** Skeletons raised by spells are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to the letter, never questioning the task their masters give them, regard&shy;less of the consequences. Because of their literal interpre&shy;tation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances.

A skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet. Some are even raised with knowledge of their past life and become formidable warriors or mages able to perform complex incantations.

Although most lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren't mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its way through an iron door, a skele&shy;ton tries the handle first. If that doesn't work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.

***Undead Nature.*** A skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Treant
Few would peer upon the stout treants and think of them as wise or strong beings, but the awakened trees have been imbued with great wisdom and strength by the spirits of the forests they dwell in. They are a product of war and strive, and little is seen of them in times of calm and peace.

***Corrupted and Unpredictable.*** During the Third War, forests would be charred and destroyed as the demons of the Burning Legion invaded Azeroth once more. <br> The destruction would be amplified through the treants as their homes and purpose was ripped and burnt away. The deforestation drove many of the stout guardians mad with grief and create a vacuum within them, a vacuum that allowed the influence of the legion to take root and drive them insane. The corruption have made many treants un&shy;predictable, driving them to lash out against any outsider, believing them to be enemies seeking to destroy what little remains of the forest around them.

Most adventurers have shown caution towards treants since the war's end as the madness of the stoic guardians won't become apparent before it is too late to retreat.

***Saplings of Ancients.*** From the saplings of ancients sprouts their primitive offspring, the treant. Beings imbued with the strength and wisdom displayed by the ancients. Like the forest around them, treants continuously grow through their life and it is believed that with enough time a treant can become an ancient protector, a devout guardian tasked with keeping the forests safe.

***Guardians of Nature.*** Like ancients, treants serve the forces of nature above all else. In times of strive they are the ones who wander the forests, seeking out those who have wronged it and flinging their barbed claws at creatures who dare to violate what is sacred.  

Their task of safe-guarding nature have granted them favors among woodland creatures and druids, making it rare to see treants wandering alone as they are often accompanied by others of sprouts or beings of the forest.

## Troggs
Troggs are savage creatures with long, muscular arms and muscles that appear as if carved from stone. They grow thick, coarse beards in colors resembling chalk or granite, and it is not rare to see minerals growing on their flesh. Their slouched posture and burly proportions have many characterizing them as apelike troglodytes.

***Titanic origins.*** After the titanic Keepers had ended their war with the Old Gods, they set to work on shaping a new generation of titan-forged creatures within the Titan complex of Ulduar. Regrettably, their initial designs proved far too complex, yielding a race of brutish stone-skinned monstrosities -- troggs. Though the Keepers quickly went to rectify their mistakes, they could not bring themselves to destroying the defect creations. Rather, the titanic Keeper *Ironaya* would oversee the construction of the vault of Uldaman; a facility that would serve as a stasis chamber for the troggs, with herself as its designated warden.

Over the years, a few small groups managed to break free from Uldaman. Some of these scattered themselves out across the surface of Azeroth, while others burrowed their way deeper down to dwell in the subterranean caverns of *Deepholm*. The rest stayed as they were, asleep beneath the earth, until a dwarven excavation unearthed the titanic vault. Once the seal was broken and the troggs awoke, they quickly overpowered the dwarves and swarmed to the surface.

There, the troggs burrowed their way through every peak and valley across Khaz Modan, including the subterranean gnomish city of Gnomeregan. To this day, trogg tribes can be found in every corner of the Khaz Modan -- with distant cousins across Azeroth, above and beneath the earth.

***Progenitor race.*** Since the troggs were the initial failed experiment of the titanic Keepers -- to flourish new life on Azeroth, their failure became the blueprint for future revised designs -- and ultimately, the *earthen*. A race of stone-carved beings created to help shape and order the subterranean regions of the world during the ordering of Azeroth, of which some later became the creatures since known as dwarves.

Theories have also been floated, mainly by the prominent dwarven explorer Brann Bronzebeard, that the *kobolds* are themselves an evolved offshoot from an early group of troggs. Likely one that earlier broke free from the titanic vault of Uldaman, however, there has been no conclusive evidence of this, only theories based on their resemblance.

***Primitive and fierce.*** Troggs are best known for their stature, ferocity, and smell -- said to resemble a mixture of mold, mange, and sour monkey. Living together in tight-knit tribes and clans, their main driving force is an imposing psyche and impressive force of will, though they are not known to be intelligent beyond being sentient. Less so than even an ogre would be considered. They follow the leadership of whoever can prove themselves the biggest and strongest, with aspiring trogg chieftains often going to great lengths to prove their viciousness. Troggs are known to eat whatever they can get their hands on; including rocks, or even occasionally other troggs.

***Underground creatures.*** With most of their existence spent underground, troggs are not fond of sunlight. Wher&shy;ever troggs dwell, a deep network of intertwining tunnels is likely to be somewhere nearby. They do most of their digging by hand, using their jagged claws, and occasionally shape weapons and other tools out of the rocks they excavate. Like the troggs themselves, a trogg dwelling is ill-reputed for is repulsive smell.

### Trogg Names and Language
Troggs do not possess any discernible language of their own, and tend to resort to violence rather than negotiation when faced with a threat. Still, those who do communicate do so in a mixture of grunts and what Common they know.

Their names draw from the same roots as the dwarven language, especially with its hard consonants and guttural sounds. Some troggs, usually tribe leaders, choose names in Common to best describe themselves. It is unclear whether these names are direct translations, or deliberate choices to intimidate other races.

Trogg tribes are usually in Common, and often draw from their way of being or directly from whichever place they claim as their home.

<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

**Trogg Names:** Argh, Agrok, Bruggor, Gorgash, Grimlok,
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morloch, Murdaloc, Raggosh, Revelosh

## Trolls
Trolls have made their mark upon the world through thousands of years as ancient divides among their race have resulted in a number of distinct troll kins, each with their own appearance, customs, and way of life. Trolls can be found across Azeroth as the race have scattered and settled in the farthest reaches of the world.

***Rulers of Kalimdor.*** When the world was still known <br> as Kalimdor, the troll race flourished under the rule of <br> the powerful and influential Zandalari, an empire of trolls capable of matching the mighty mogu dynasty. The Zan&shy;dalari Emprie was heavily dependent on a caste system, and as time went on many of those castes would evolve <br> into a people of their own and leave the Zandalari Empire, marking the beginning of the divide among all trolls.

Over time two distinct empires would emerge to rival the Zandalari Empire, the Amani and Gurubashi, with smaller tribes settling in farther reaches of Azeroth. Although the new empires held some animosity for one another, the many threats of Azeroth would draw a common enemy between them, resulting in them rarely being warred.

Thousands of years later, a colony of dark trolls would break from the Amani empire and discover the cosmic Well of Eternity at Kalimdors center, by the wells influence they would be transformed into the kaldorei -- night elves. <br> The night elves built a strong empire for themselves at the heart of Kalimdor and systematically dismantled the trolls' defenses, leaving the empires with fragments of the power they previously boasted.

Eventually, the night elves' reckless overuse of magic lured the demonic Burning Legion to the world. Igniting the War of the Ancients. At its end, the Well of Eternity would implode, resulting in a shockwave that shattered the great Kalimdor into the world it is today. Great chunks of the remaining Amani and Gurubashi empires were lost, but plenty of land remained for the trolls to rebuild their ravaged cities and reclaim their territories free from the struggles of night elves.

***Racial Differences.*** The troll race is considered one of the most separated, their ancient divide has turned each tribe into a unique race of their own with customs not seen in other tribes. They have settled across the face of Azeroth and adapted to the environment around them.

***Tribal Preference.*** Trolls have always been a tribal race, isolating themselves and starting anew. A trolls tribe is its family, and many will go to extreme lengths to protect those of its tribe, owing loyalty to no one but those of the tribe.

***Outside Hostility.*** Trolls settle in remote and isolated area, regions where the trolls can gain influence and start a new empire. They are known for their territorial behavior and will retaliate with force and fierce numbers if their empire's borders are threatened.

***Loa's Guidance.*** Loa is the name trolls have given to the animalistic spirit gods of the world. Countless loa exist, many of them weak and shapeless beings that only trolls can sense, whilst others take the form of majestic animals. Troll societies make up loas of their own, families might have a family loa, cities their own civic deities, and empires can havs sanctioned certain loas above others.

***Regeneration.*** Smashing a troll's bones and slashing through its rubbery hide only makes them angry as their wounds close at an extraordinary speed. Only through acid or fire can a creature arrest the regenerative properties of a troll, however, their natural regeneration can only restore so much and once the heart pumps its last there's no way for it to retaliate.

## Thunder Lizard
Few who scout a thunder lizard approaching dare engage the beast in an open skirmish. The thick-skinned beasts bears a striking resemblance to kodos and many have speculated that the two are related in one way or another.

But that is where the similarities between the creatures ends, as the monstrous thunder lizard is easily aggravated, persistent in hunting down those who provoked it, and capable of exhaling a streak of lightning towards it target.

***Creature of Myth.*** Thunder lizards are considered mystical creatures and a rare sight by many, only made rarer by their aggressive nature putting an end to any who doesn't take appropriate precautions before attempting to get a closer look.

The mighty tauren think of thunder lizards as a creature of legend. Believing that the spirits of kodos can be bound by the sky and storm, creating the thundering monsters.

***Grassland Scavengers.*** The thunderous monsters roam the vast plains of Kalimdor in search of prey to consume. Thunder lizards are carnivorous and will eat their prey whole and dissolving the body and everything the creature carried with it in the process, with magical items leaving with its excrements.

In their great hunt for food, wary scouts have noticed that the great thunder lizards leave ordinary kodos unharmed and seek nutrients elsewhere.

***Lone Wanderers.*** Thunder lizards are rarely found in large numbers, preferring to hunt alone or following a pack of kodos around as a fearsome guardian. They move vast distances in their tireless hunt for food and tales have been told of thunder lizards wandering carelessly through the streets of open settlements, often leaving little in their wake if first aggravated.

## Whale Shark
In the depths of the ocean, beneath the sunlit reaches of the Great Sea swims the arbiter of the deep. Known to many simple as whale sharks, these legendary leviathans patrol the sunken depths and devour any inattentive or overzealous adventurer that cross their paths.

***Devourer of All*** These horrific leviathans swim through the oceans of Azeroth in an eternal hunt for survival. They care little for what -- or who -- gets swallowed into the darkness by their maw, it will provide them with nutrients in either case. Whale sharks are rarely aggressive enough to directly hunt down prey and often its swallowed prey are but unfortunate creatures caught in front of its maw.

***Guardians of the Deeps.*** Whale sharks are known for being territorial creatures, often swimming in great circles around the borders of their territory, swallowing everything that passes by their maw. These sharks have been traced to roaming the waters of ancient ruins and it is speculated that they are safeguarding the forgotten ruins.

However, few adventurers have been foolish, or brave, enough to swim into the eye of their realm to unearth what forgotten world they might be guarding.

## Wind Serpents
Slithering across in the plains of Mulgore, flying through the frosty trees of Winterspring, or prowling beneath the burning sand of Tanaris. Wind serpents are adapt creatures who can be found in all corners of Azeroth, the serpentine beasts rarely pays any attention to those who wander by, but once hungry -- or aggravated -- they become hostile and fearsome beasts with a venomous bite and innate ability to spew elemental forces at their foe.

A wind serpent combines the body and head of a snake with the leathery wings of a drake, and the feathers of a brightly colored bird.

***Spiritual Creatures.*** Wind serpents are often seen by less intelligent creatures as spirits of the sky and have long since been revered by tribal races such as the quilboars. The serpents also carry a resemblance towards the loa Hakkar the Soulflayer, giving them the name "children of hakkar" by his worshippers and earning them a favorable place at their side.

***Unseen Hunters.*** The serpentine beasts are formidable hunters, they are predators who utilize the environment to ambush their prey for a moments advantage. Crawling among tree branches, stalk within fissures, or flying silently out from dark nooks towards their desired target. 

They attack with lightning speed and swiftly retreat once the blow has been dealt, stalking for the next opening in their targets defense. Perceptive adventurers might catch a glimpse of their colorful scales in their surroundings, a warning of their presence -- and potential quarry.

***Adapted Species.*** Wind serpents can be found in the far reaches of the world. They nest in hard-to-reach places where they can retire in safety. The different subspecies of wind serpents have adapted and adjusted to the environ&shy;ment around them, changing color and elemental to better survive their harsh surroundings.

> ##### Variant: Adapted Wind Serpents
> Wind serpents are found throughout Azeroth and have adapted differently to their climate. 
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can change a wind serpent's *lightning breath* and *shocking spit* attacks to deal cold or poison damage instead of lightning by making the following changes to the attacks:
>
> ***Breath Attack.*** The breath attack becomes a cone of a size equal to half the line's length, and requires a Constitution saving throw to resist.
>
> ***Spit.*** The spit attack requires a Constitution saving throw to resist.

## Wretched
Creatures who failed to control their innate addiction to magic and overindulged in arcane to the point of deformity, that is the story of the wretched elves. These thin elves are descendants of Quel'thalas, a danger to both themselves and others with their violent and unpredictable nature.

These elves resemble unnaturally thin high elves, with claw-like fingers and strange crystalline growths appearing across their skin, giving off an eerie glow in darkness. All of these elves were once part of the Kingdom to Quel'thalas, unable to control their addiction to magic and falling into a crevice from which there is no escape and no turning back.

***Insane Elves.*** Wretched are obsessed with magic and will go to extreme lengths to obtain magic items and devouring the magical energy within them. This obsessing often pushes many wretched into insanity as they fixate on objects of magical power and how to extract that power.

Attempting to bargain with wretched for safe passage is rarely resolved peacefully as the unpredictable nature of the elves makes them aggressive and easy to anger. 

***Pest of Quel'thalas.*** The wretched elves rarely leave <br> the confines of Quel'thalas, instead they have scattered through the kingdom and taken up residence in the ruins left behind by the Scourge. There the wretched gather and let their addiction to magic take its toll. 

Because of their violent temperament and unpredictable nature few wretched have been able to gather the wretched under a single rule and fight back against Quel'thalas, but should such a leader ever arise the wretched would be a true threat to the blood elves, however, with their current behavior the wretched are little more than a pest.

### Wretched Names
Wretched were once blood elves and as such continue to speak the Thalassian tongue, although few among them how shown signs of remembering the Common language.

Their overindulgence have lead many wretched into insanity, some forgetting their names entirely, or choosing to take a new one more appropriate. Wretched use the same naming conventions as high and blood elves, but instead of surnames many wretched give themselves titles that describes their newfound personality for others, like *the Reckless* or *the Hungerer*.

> ##### Variant: Magic Absorption
> Wretched have an insatiable craving for magic and will go extreme lengths to obtain and consume it. Some wretched are able to devour the essence of a magic item and be empowered by it.
>
> A wretched devourer has a challenge rating of 1/2 (100 XP) and gains the following action option.
> 
> ***Devour Magic (Recharge 6).*** The wretched chooses one creature within 60 feet of it, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or have one of its magic items lose all magical properties until the start of the wretched's next turn. If the object is a charged item, it also loses 1d4 charges. Determine the effected item randomly, ignoring single-use items such as potions and scrolls.
>
> If the wretched successfully devours the magic of an item, it regains the use of one of its *once per day* innate spellcasting spells.

The curse of the worgen can transform the most civilized humanoids into ravening lupines, primal beasts filled with rage that gradually lose all vestiges of their former lives and turn into mindless predators. These feral beings bear more of a resemblance with monstrous wolves than intelligent humanoids, however, close inspection of their eyes reveals the intelligent creature that lives within.

***Ancient Curse.*** The worgen curse originates from night elves who attempted to tame the powers of the ancient Godrinn and instead transformed themselves into the first worgens. These feral creatures would be locked away in the Emerald Dream for centuries, only to be released as a weapon against the forsaken invasion in Gilneas. The feral worgens were effective, however, they did not differentiate between forsaken and humans, spreading their curse like a rapid disease through the kingdom.

***Pack Animals.*** Feral worgens have but a shred of humanity left, they have become predatory animals that can't be reasoned or communicated with. Like wolves they live in large packs within forested areas, following the strongest of amongst them -- the alpha.

***Humanoid Cubs.*** Worgens do not give birth to lupine humanoids, but instead give birth to a humanoid of their original race. Although the mother of the child might have an affection towards it, that affection is not shared by the rest of its pack who see the child as no more than food.

***Undeath Resistance.*** The curse of the worgen draws its power from both the emerald dream and the holy power of the goddess Elune. These polar opposite forces to death have made rising worgens into undeath far more difficult than it is for normal humanoids. 

***Feral Weaknesses.*** These feral beasts are vicious, inti&shy;midated by nothing and with a pack mentality to strong that they rarely back down. However, the beasts have shown a dislike of open fires, often avoiding areas lit by open flames whenever possible. A room lit by braziers might make the worgens stop momentarily, but the hunger for flesh will drive them onwards if need be.

They have also shown a poisonous reaction towards the wolfsbane plant, a minuscule flower sprouting through the kingdom of Gilneas. When the harmless plant comes into contact with their open wounds, it seemingly prevents the worgen from recuperating.

> ##### Player Characters as Feral Worgens
> A humanoid bit by a worgen must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed. The curse has no effect on undead beings, such as the forsaken. A character bit begins to show the effects of the curse after 1d4 days, at which point the character is transformed into a feral worgen. It gains a Strength of 15 if their score isn't already higher, and their alignment changes to Chaotic Evil.
>
> The cursed character also gains the following indefinite madness, *"I hunger for the taste of blood and will kill anyone to taste it once more."*
>
> The character remains a feral worgen until a *greater restoration* spell or more powerful magic rids the character of their indefinite madness, at which point alignment returns to what it was before being bit, and the character gains the *Two Forms* feature and the *Worgen Form Traits* of the Worgen race.

## Yeti
Yetis -- also known as Wendigos -- are hulking monstrosities that roam remote forests and snowy mountains with a territorial ferocity rarely seen in other creatures. They make for terrifying and powerful foes willing to hunt any creature that wanders too close to their den, striking fear into their weary hearts.

***Territorial Beings.*** The territorial nature of yetis is common knowledge to the settlements near its border as the monstrous yeti is often seen roaming its vast territory, laying claim to any creature who dares venture too close. Yetis have a desire for killing that can't be quenched and will continue to hunt even when they are not hungry, dragging the spoils back to their lair for the next meal.

Driven by their desire to hunt a yeti is seldom found within its den, but rather encountered wandering <br> through the snow of the area around it.

***Horrific Dens.*** Yetis make their dens in caverns and under isolated overhangs, few can mistake the den of <br> a yeti for it is easily recognizable by the amass of bones strewn across its floor and an array of half eaten corpses.

It can often mean untold riches for strong-hearted adventurers, as the monstrous creatures place no value on the possessions of their prey, strewing it through its den like gnawed bones for other to collect -- or die trying.

***Solitary Hunters.*** Most yetis are lone wanderers that wander their territory alone and serve only themselves, but yetis are not as unintelligent as they are let out to be and know that there is strength in numbers. They are willing to work together to survive -- after the strongest amongst them have shown dominance --and terrorize the land around them, desolating it of game.

### Abominable Yeti
Abominable yetis are menacing creatures towering above normal yetis with the posture of enormous apes, they make their dens high in the mountains in places so remote that no one would dare to venture close. They care little for safe-guarding a large perimeter and hunt only to survive, however, they are far more aggressive in their hunt and willing to venture much further from their den for food.

Little else is known of these beings as few have encountered them and lived to tell their tale, but evidence of their existence can be heard by their primal roars as it echoes through the mountains.

A **carrion bird** is a large carnivorous, scavenger bird found across Azeroth. These birds usually have featherless heads and broad wingspans. They stalk their prey from the skies and lurk from a distance, waiting for it to fall to the ground out of exhaustion or for someone else to finish it off.

A **lion** is a common sight across central Kalimdor. These fierce predators stalk the tall grass in small packs -- their prides -- and have been known to even hunt travellers.

More commonplace across Azeroth is the **mountain lion**, found both along the lush plains of Mulgore and up the grassy foothills of Hillsbrad.

A **zhevra** is a large zebra with the horn piercing through its forehead similar to that of a unicorn. These horse-like creatures are considerably passive and more frightened of others than they are curious or hostile, preferring to run away rather than fight.

This has been a project made by a group of people who have loved the Warcraft franchise for many years at this point, and wanted to bring it into Dungeons and Dragons for everyone to enjoy.

This has been a blast for us to make, and we thoroughly enjoy making it and improving upon it. We hope this will bring joy to many D&D tables around the world. Best of luck to all the parties of humans and orcs, try not to chop each other up too much <3
