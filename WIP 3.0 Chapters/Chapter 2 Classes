# Chapter 2: Classes
Heroes are extraordinary people, driven by a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. Your class is the pri&shy;mary definition of what your character can do. It's more than a profession; it's your character's calling. A class shapes the way you think about the world
<br> and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the multiverse. A warrior, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneu&shy;vering, and see herself as a pawn in a much larger game.
<br> A priest, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant in a force's unfolding plan or conflict. While the warrior has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the priest might know a number of healers, paladins, and devotees who share his faith.

Your class gives you a variety of special features, such
<br> as a warrior's mastery of weapons and armor, and a mage's spells. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing features often improve. 

Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and a detailed explanation of each one.

Heroes sometimes advance in more than one class. A rogue might switch direction in life and swear the oath of a paladin. A barbaric warrior might discover latent magical ability and dabble in the arcane arts while continuing to advance as a warrior.
