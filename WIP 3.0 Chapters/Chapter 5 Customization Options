# Chapter 5: Customization Options
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, exper-ience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Battlemage feat requires you to be able to cast a spell. If you lose your ability to cast spells somehow you can't bene-fit from the Battlemage spell until that ability is restored.

The feats presented in this book are meant as additions to those presented in the 5th edition Player's Handbook.

## Racial Feats
Leveling up in a class is the main way a character evolves during a campaign. Some DMs also allow the use of feats to customize a character. Feats are an optional rule in chapter 6, of the *Player's Handbook*. The DM decides whether they're used and may also decide that some feats are available in a campaign and others aren't. 

This section introduces a collection of special feats that allow you to explore your character's race further. These feats are each associated with a race from chapter 1, as summarized in the Racial Feats table. A racial feat repre-sents either a deepening connection to your race's culture or a physical transformation that brings you closer to an aspect of your race's lineage.

The cause of a particular transformation is up to you and your DM. A transformational feat can symbolize a latent quality that has emerged as you age, or a transformation might be the result of an event in the campaign, such as ex-posure to powerful magic or visiting a place of ancient sig-nificance to your race. Figuring out why your character has changed can be a rich addition to your campaign's story.
