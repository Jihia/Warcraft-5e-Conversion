## Bog beasts
Bog beasts are large plant-like creatures, <br>often found in temperate marshes of Azeroth. <br>These massive plants may be mistaken for a thick <br>clump of vegetation if not for their vaguely humanoid shapes and surprising mobility.  

***Creatures of Mystery.*** As the name suggests, bog-beasts are massive, shambling monsters that are half plant and half beast, but not much is known about these secretive lords of the swamp, except that they are territorial and rather aggressive.

***Natural Power.*** Explorers have recorded stories of their immense strength and resilience to harm. Bog-beasts use their strength to slam into their enemies, crushing opponents' defenses with their fists and whatever large objects they can throw at them.

***Plant-like Anatomy.*** A bog beast's roots, which grow on the outside of their bodies, are suitable for consumption.

The fungus that also grows on them can be combined with the heart of a panther and the blood of a green dragon to make a truth serum, while dew glands found within the bog beast can be used as a makeshift water sac.

### Timberling
A timberling is a twisted mass of branches, vines, and leaves that lumbers forward, rustling with each step. Its body has a vaguely humanoid shape, standing four feet high and weighing around 50 pounds. They do not speak or understand any known language.

They are normally peaceful creatures that live in harmony with the land, but any sort of disruption (such as pollution) drives them into an unnatural frenzy. An angered timberling attacks anything that moves. Timberlings can be made peaceful again only by removing the source of their discomfort and returning the land to its natural state.

### Thistleshrub
A thistleshrub is a large plant and plant elemental found in Tanaris. These elementals protect the Thistleshrub Valley - these are creatures of living vines, attacking anything that comes near.

It looks like a patch of cactus-like briars that shudders and then begins to move. It forms massive, gnarled arms covered in wicked thorns.

### Swampwalker
Swampwalkers are similar to most timberlings, but are darker green in color. They dwell almost exclusively in swamps, defending their territory from any intruders. A swampwalker is naturally stealthy and usually lurks just under the surface of the water, lashing out at any creature that comes near. 
They particularly loathe fire and go after anyone holding or wielding a flame, no matter how small or inoffensive the flame may seem.

### Tar Creeper
Tar Creepers are elementals made of living tar found around the Lakkari Tar Pits in Un'Goro Crater.

>
> ***Water Awareness.*** The thistleshrub can sense the pre­sence of water reservoirs up to 5 miles away, as well as water within a creature's body. It knows the general direction they're in but no their exact location.

>
> ***Thorny Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage.

>
> ***Entangling Roots (Recharge 5-6).*** Grasping thorny roots and vines sprout in a 15-foot radius centered on the thistleshrub, withering away after 1 minute. For the duration, that area is difficult terrain for non plant creatures. In addition, each creature of the thistleshrub's choice in that area when the plants appear must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or become restrained. While restrained in this way, the target takes 9 (2d8) piercing damage at the start of their turn. A creature can use its action to make a DC 14 Strength check, freeing itself or another entangled creature within reach on a success.
