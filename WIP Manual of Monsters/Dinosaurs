# Dinosaurs
Dinosaurs are among the oldest reptiles in the world, ancient in every sense of the word. Their presence can inspire both awe and dread into any adventurer fortunate -- or unfortunate -- enough to cross their path. They roam far and wide across Azeroth; all the way from remote mountain valleys, to humid jungles, and to rugged barren plains. 

***Feared and Revered.*** Some of Azeroth's denizens, trolls in particular, revere dinosaurs. Several of the primal Loa take the appearance of a dinosaur, such as the devilsaur Loa Rezan and the direhorn Loa Torcali. 

For the Zandalar tribe, it is a rite of passage to venture away from home, into the wilds, in order to steal or subdue a beast. Any beast would do for such trials, but a wild dinosaur is a prized claim.

***Giants Among Beasts.*** Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes, some absolutely tremendous, featuring a wide variety of markings and colorations. They primarily split into two groups: savage, territorial predators, and docile yet still undeniably dangerous herbivores.

### Ankylodon
The ankylodon is a broad, low-slung dinosaur, native to Zandalar. It is kept up by its powerful limbs, and almost every part of its body, save for the belly, is decked with hardened plates. Long spikes protrude from these plates; <br>a characteristic appearance that has flocks of ankylodons sometimes referred to as "thornhides". It is a herbivore, preferring to graze on ferns and low shrubs, shearing them off with its beak-like upper jaw.

### Brutosaur
Brutosaurs are enormous, even among dinosaurs. They have small heads and incredibly long necks, relative to the rest of their body, and move along at a lumbering pace with their pillar-like legs. Despite their imposing stature, bruto&shy;saurs are known to be very docile unless threatened. They are omnivores, yet most appear to have an exclusively herb&shy;ivorous diet, rarely ever hunting meat of their own volition.

### Devilsaur
This giant lizard stands tall on its two powerful hind legs, with two stunted forelimbs stretched out before it. The devilsaur takes its name from its utterly savage attacks, as it tackles its prey down with immense force before tearing it limb from limb. Despite its ferocity, the devilsaur's massive size has many hunters seeking the beast out for its hide, which is both supple and extraordinarily tough. Devilsaurs may grow well above thirty feet, weighing in at almost sixteen tons. 

Female devilsaurs tend to be smaller and lighter, though they are even more aggressive than their male counterpart. During mating seasons, once the nest has been made and her eggs have been laid, she will leave it to the male who fathered the clutch to protect them until they hatch.

### Diemetradon
The diemetradon—one of the strongest predators in the Un'Goro Crater—is recognized for the two enormous, jag&shy;ged crests protruding from its back. Its legs are squat and strong, for which it is far from the fastest dinosaur, though its body is decked in plate-like scales able to withstand tremendous force. When a diemetradon fights or hunts, it is known to simply lumber dead ahead against its target; rushing in to pin them down against a tree or in a swamp.

It is said that the diemetradon's howl is deafening, like a thundering boom capable of drowning out most other sounds around it.

### Direhorn
Direhorns are three-horned saurian titans known to popu&shy;late many islands throughout the South Seas. They are especially prominent on Zandalar, the Isle of Giants and the Isle of Thunder. They may seem like gentle giants at first, though they are among the toughest and strongest animals to walk on Azeroth. Even juvenile direhorns have been known to wreak utter havoc on unsuspecting victims. 

### Pterrordax
Tall as a horse and weighing up to 1,500 pounds, the pterrordax's keen senses guides it along as it soars through the air in search for fresh meat. Its claw-tipped wings are utterly tremendous, and its beak-like snout is lined with razor-sharp teeth. The pterrordax prefers to hunt alone, swooping down on unsuspecting prey from above to batter it to death with its wings before proceeding to tear flesh from bone. It is a solitary hunter, and adventurers' accounts of multiple have mainly been during mating season: a two-week period during early spring-time.

If their breeding grounds are threatened, otherwise lone pterrordax are quick to band together in large flights to fend off attackers. Afterwards, they disband just as quickly.

A pterrordax's pigmentation ranges from bright mossy greens to deep emerald hues, with brightly shining eyes. Closely related to the pterrordax is the even more terrifying pterrorwing—also known as Skyscreamer. It is massive in comparison, and stands out for the large sail on its snout.

### Raptor
The raptor is a large, aggressive dinosaur, known far and wide for its strength and immense speed. Out in the open, it is near impossible to outrun its leaping stride, and once it has caught up to its prey it pounces; driving its hooked talons in deep.

Even among dinosaurs, raptors are exceptionally intelli&shy;gent. Their packs act closer to colonies, with established hierarchies and and breeding grounds that could be mis&shy;taken for settlements when viewed from afar. They are very visually striking creatures, decked in scales and feathers ranging from bright blue and white, to striking red and orange, to deep black, purple, and green. 

### Sabertusk
Little is known about the enigmatic sabertusk, other than its nativity to Zandalar and occasional sightings on other, smaller islands nearby.  Though unwary adventurers have occasionally mistaken it for other land-dwelling reptiles, the sabertusk is visibly striking for the long and heavy tusks protruding from its maw. Its legs are long and its tail is narrow, with tall and coarse spikes running the length of its spine; all the way up to a prominent horn on its snout. 

\columnbreak

### Saurid
Saurid are small bipedal dinosaurs native to Zandalar, known for their nimble grace and venomous bite. The Zandalari trolls consider the saurid to be vermin, no better than rats, as they frequently steal food, poison waters, and prey on children and on the wounded.

However, when Zandalar renewed their alliance with the mogu at the Isle of Thunder, they brought the saurid with them to train. There, the tiny critters proved an immensely valuable weapon in the trolls' arsenal, let out loose in the wilds to hunt in the night.

### Stegodon
Stegodons are large herbivorous dinosaurs, whose massive bodies are heaved along on legs the size of tree trunks. They are notorious for their short temper and alarmingly aggressive turns, often attacking trespassers on sight as they patrol their territories. An enormous horn extends from the stegodon's snout, and spike-like plates run like a jagged fin across the length of its spine, over a back decked in hardened scales. Most stegodons have skin in dark shades of green, though some grow paler and grittier hues.

### Threshadon
The threshadon is a marine dinosaur, whose compact body is driven by a set of powerful flippers. Much like a bruto&shy;saur, its neck accounts for a third of its total length, and is able to flex and twist in whichever direction it needs to dig around muddy lake-beds and pull branches from riversides.

Though they are herbivores first and foremost, grazing threshadon herds are notorious for how fast they tear through and and all plant life within reach—before migrat&shy;ing on to new grounds. When a herd has found a grazing spot, the threshadons defend it aggressively. Any other creatures they encounter are attacked on sight. When it fights, the threshadon uses its long neck to lunge at its target, dealing devastating blows with rows of long, jagged teeth. Its jaws are strong enough to crush armor and snap bones, and it is not unusual for it to consume it kills whole.

> ***Maim.*** One creature grappled by the devilsaur's bite takes 59 (8d12 + 7) piercing damage. If this reduces the creature to 0 hp, the devilsaur swallows it and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the devilsaur, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the devilsaur's turns.
> If the Devilsaur takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from creatures inside it, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of it. If the devilsaur dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by him and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

> ***Legendary Resistance (1/Day).*** If the devilsaur king fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
>
> ***Trample.*** Whenever the devilsaur moves into an area occupied by a Medium or smaller creature, the creature must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, taking 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The devilsaur king makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. It can't make both attacks against the same target.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 39 (5d12 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 19) . Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the devilsaur king can't bite another target.
>
> ***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (4d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the devilsaur king and knocked prone.
>
> ***Maim.*** One grappled creature takes 59 (8d12 + 7) piercing damage. If this reduces the creature to 0 hp, the devilsaur swallows it and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the devilsaur king, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the devilsaur king's turns.
If the devil&shy;saur king takes 45 damage or more on a single turn from creatures inside it, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of it. If the devilsaur king dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.
>
> ***Terrifying Roar.***  Each creature within 60 feet of the devilsaur king that can hear him must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The devilsaur king can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The devilsaur king regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

> <br> **Terrifying Roar** The devilsaur king uses Terrifying Roar.
> <br> **Swallow (Costs 2 Actions).** The devilsaur king swallows <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a creature it is grappling and the grapple ends. <!--https://wc5e-cr-calculator.frogvall.com/?2;15;187;14;12;75;11;75;32;75;53;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;;;3;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;10;;;;;;-->
