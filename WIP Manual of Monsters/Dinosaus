## Devilsaur

This giant lizard walks on two powerfully muscled hind legs. Two stunted, taloned forelimbs stretch out before it, and rows of bloodstained teeth fill its maw. The devilsaur takes its name from its vicious, relentless attacks, during which it utterly savages its victims to death. The devilsaur uses its bite to assault its prey, and its powerful hind legs and sheer size allow it to chase down almost any chosen prey. Despite the ferocity of this ill-tempered beast, hunters prize its extraordinarily tough but supple hide and often seek it out. Devilsaurs can grow to heights exceeding thirty feet and can weigh almost sixteen tons. Females tend to be smaller and lighter than males, but are even more aggressive. In a reversal of most creatures’ natural gender roles, a female devilsaur abandons her eggs as soon as she lays them; male devilsaurs can identify a clutch of eggs they've fathered by scent, and will protect that clutch until the eggs hatch. The devilsaur uses its intimidating speed to charge prey a soon as they are within range. It typically targets the smallest creatures in a pack first, closing its powerful jaws over them and lifting them off the ground. The devilsaur mauls its prey, biting and shaking until it or the enemy stops moving, swallows, and then moves on to the next target. Badly wounded devilsaurs have been known to flee, sometimes carrying opponents with them.

## Diemetradon

The diemetradon — one of the strongest predators in the Un'Goro Crater — stalks its prey and rips it apart without mercy. Thick, shell-like plates cover this dinosaur's thick hide. Its six powerful stumpy legs end in sharp claws, and jagged teeth line its mouth. Two enormous, jagged red crests protrude from its back. This creature uses both its squat, strong legs tipped with sharp claws and its wickedly fanged mouth to great advantage, tearing apart its prey without a second thought. The diemetradon lumbers straight into battle, ripping and tearing with its claws and teeth. It targets enemies that deal large amounts of damage to it and attempts to dispatch them as quickly as possible, using its powerful attack to full advantage. The diemetradon also attempts to bull rush its enemies into trees or swampy areas.

## Direhorn

Direhorns are three-horned dinosaurs found mainly on Zandalar, the Isle of Giants and the Isle of Thunder. These saurian titans populate many islands in the South Seas. Though they can seem like gentle giants, they are among the toughest and strongest of all things that walk on Azeroth. Even at a tiny size, direhorns are known to wreak havoc on unsuspecting victims.

## Pterrordax

Pterrordax soar through the air, using their keen predator's senses to satisfy their taste for fresh meat. These fierce creatures stand as tall as a horse and weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Their pigmentation ranges from moss green to deep emerald. Claw-tipped wings stretch out form the back of the reptilian creature. Green eyes shine above a long, beaklike snout lined with razor teeth. While weaker than other dinosaurs, pterrordax possess great agility. Pterrordax prefer to hunt alone; normally, adventurers encounter them in pairs only during mating season, a two-week period in the springtime. Pterrordax may form flights when their breeding grounds are threatened by a strong foe, but disband once they eliminate the threat. A hungry pterrordax attacks any creature smaller than itself, disdaining carrion. It batters enemies to death with its clawed wings and tears the flesh from bones with its fanged beak. A badly wounded pterrordax retreats and flies back to its lair to rest.

## Sabertusk

## Saurid

Saurid, are small, bipedal dinosaurs with a venomous bite native to Zandalar. The Zandalari trolls consider them to be vermin no better than rats, as they frequently gnaw at the trolls' food, poison their waters, hunt their children and eat their wounded. However, when the Zandalari renewed their alliance with the mogu, they brought saurid with them to the Isle of Thunder and began training them, proving that even the vermin of the Zandalari are a weapon in the trolls' arsenal. Saurid have been known to kill both Kirin Tor Offensive and Sunreaver Onslaught soldiers by sneaking into their tents at night. The Zandalari raptors and saurid represented a substantial threat to their forces, and they were described as superb hunting beasts that could track prey over great distances and were often lethal to encounter when caught unawares.

## Stegodon

Stegodons are short-tempered, aggressive, but herbivorous dinosaurs. This massive reptilian creature heaves itself along on four legs the size of tree trunks. A stunted tail sticks out behind it and dark green spikes cover its body. An enormous tusk extends from its blunt snout. Easily irritated, they attack trespassers on sight, but rarely venture from their territories. They consume vast quantities of plant matter and grow angry when logging, mining, and other such activities disturb their food sources. A stegadon begins combat charging, and impaling its attacker. Vicious opponents, these dinosaurs gore and trample to debilitate enemies as swiftly as possible. Stegadons are stubborn creatures and often fight to the death.
