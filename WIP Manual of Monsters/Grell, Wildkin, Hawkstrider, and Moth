## Grell
The grell are forest spirits that resemble imps but are generally larger in size, lack the characteristic horns, and are not demonic. Grells come in both melee and spell caster variants. They are actually embodiments of the wild side of nature, and so tame ones are very rare. 

***Mischievous Creatures.*** Grell are small, playful creatures that can be encountered in wild areas. They are not particularly dangerous individually, but in gangs they can pose a threat to outlying night elf and furbolg communities; they may be small and unimpressive, but their claws are sharp.

In general grell are not particularly hostile; generally, they are content to leave potential dangers alone. If an opponent attacks, however, they defend themselves fiercely. Grell in a gang feel no particular connection to each other, it seems, and are as likely to assist their comrade as to watch the combat idly.

## Wildkin
The wildkin are serene, powerful creatures, acting as a powerful force for good and a staunch ally of the night elves. They resemble cross between a bear and a horned owl, which explains both their wisdom and ferocity. They act as a powerful force for good and a staunch ally of the night elves.

***Humble Creatures.*** Most wildkin treat peaceful travelers with respect, sometimes coming to their aid or assisting lost visitors out of their forests.

While good-tempered and wise, the wildkin fights fiercely against evildoers, especially undead and the forces of the Burning Legion.

***Elune's Creations.*** Some night elf scholars claim that wildkin are the creation of Elune, that she created them to guard all of her sacred places. They claim that Elune created the first wildkin in the early days of the world to serve as guardians to Cenarius.

But now, many years later, the wildkin have grown more feral, and without the guidance of the goddess, they are confused. They wander without purpose, though many find their way back to the sacred areas that they once were sworn to protect.

### Moonkin
Related to wildkin, moonkin are large, flightless, sapient bird-like creatures, blessed by Elune to spread nature's grace wherever they travel.
