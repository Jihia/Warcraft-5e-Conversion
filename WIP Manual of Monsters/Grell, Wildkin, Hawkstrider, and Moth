## Grell
The grell are forest spirits that resemble imps but are generally larger in size, lack the characteristic horns, and are not demonic. Grells come in both melee and spell caster variants. They are actually embodiments of the wild side of nature, and so tame ones are very rare. 

***Mischievous Creatures.*** Grell are small, playful creatures that can be encountered in wild areas. They are not particularly dangerous individually, but in gangs they can pose a threat to outlying night elf and furbolg communities; they may be small and unimpressive, but their claws are sharp.

In general grell are not particularly hostile; generally, they are content to leave potential dangers alone. If an opponent attacks, however, they defend themselves fiercely. Grell in a gang feel no particular connection to each other, it seems, and are as likely to assist their comrade as to watch the combat idly.
