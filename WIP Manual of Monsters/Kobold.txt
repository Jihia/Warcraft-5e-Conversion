> ##### Candles in the Dark
> Kobold legends speak of a devouring presence, hiding in the darkness, giving to them their over­whelming fear of the dark. 
> 
> As an optional rule, consider the following: 
>
> A kobold without a lit candle, who is standing in dim light or darkness, must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The kobold can repeat the saving throw at the end of each its turns, also ending the effect if it manages to light a candle again.
>
> On a successful save, if another creature was responsible for the loss of candlelight, the kobold deals an extra 4 (1d6) damage when it hits that creature with a melee attack.
