### Radiation Sickness
This disease affects humanoids and beasts, and spreads quickly to other unaffected creatures once it has taken hold. It contaminates the mind and body of the affected creature, and follows after it in a thick cloud of miasma.

When a creature comes in direct contact with a radiation source, such as touching radiated fallout, drinking radiated water, or being bitten by a radiated creature, or if a creature spends an hour in an area contaminated by the radiation, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.

It takes 1d4 days for the sickness to manifest symptoms in an infected creature. Once it does, the creature starts to take on a sickly appearance, with sickly green abscesses spreading across the characters skin.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. The saving throw DC increases by 2 for each consecutive success, before resetting once the creature fails the save.

On a failed saving throw, the creature gains one level of exhaustion, up to a maximum of four levels of exhaustion before it stops increasing. As the exhaustion builds, the creature's skin turns increasingly green and calloused.

Once the creature reaches four levels of exhaustion, it gains one randomly determined *indefinite madness*, as described in the 5th Edition *Dungeon Master's Guide*, and the Miasma feature until cured.

The radiation sickness can be cured by spells such as *lesser restoration* or *heal*.
