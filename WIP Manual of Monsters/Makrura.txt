## Makrura
The makrura, also known as lobstrok, are a race of aquatic humanoid lobsters (or more likely crayfish) that live primarily in the sea, but are capable of surviving on land for short periods of time. These crustaceans live in colonies along the shores of Aszeroth and in the deeper oceans.

***Natural Aggression.*** Makrura are  incredibly hostile and will attempt to kill anybody that comes near them. They are often found underwater guarding shipwrecks.  

Makrura fight by grappling an opponent with one pincer and holding it in place while the other pincer tears it apart. Makrura defend their territory aggressively, and they attack murlocs and naga on sight.

***Savory Prey.*** Makrura suffer from the extreme disadvantage of being tasty to many carnivorous races, a fact appreciated all too well by their enemies on both land and sea. While land dwellers sometimes hunt them for food, a makruraâ€™s most hated enemies are murlocs and naga (but especially the latter). 

### Makrura Tidecaller
Even though it is very uncommon, some makrura has an innate capacity for water magic. The makrura tidecallers are shamans who use their magic to attack their enemies and protect their allies.
