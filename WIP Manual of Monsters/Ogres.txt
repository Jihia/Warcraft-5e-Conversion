## Ogres
Ogres are large, brutish humanoids of notable strength native to Draenor. Their society is based on a clan structure, each clan acting independently of the others. 

***Scattered Around the World.*** Following the defeat of the Horde at the end of the Second War, the ogre clans dispersed in all directions. Some escaped through the Dark Portal back to Draenor, some made the difficult journey across the Great Sea to the distacnt continent of Kalimdor, while others remained in the Eastern Kingdoms.

***Formidable Apperance.***  For an ogre the most important physical attribute is size. Since they prefer to show off their physique, ogres eschew garments that cover too much skin. 

Sometimes, if they want to look more fearsome to their enemies, they adorn their bodies with warpaints created using mortars and pestles.

***Brute Fighters.*** Ogres are straight forward in combat and often suffer as much punishment as they dish out, relying on their strength and stamina to carry them to victory at the battles end.

They are vicious opponents, with the strength to rip off a warrior's limbs should they so choose. The ogres favor huge, spiked clubs that they use to bash in the skulls of their enemies and to bring down the large prey they hunt.

***Two-Headed Ogres and Magic Affinity.*** Ogres are naturally attuned to the arcane. They hold a special affinity for the earth, able to use arcane power to shape and bend rock and stone to their will. Due to the ancient ogres' pra-ctice of sorcery and exposure to raw arcane magic, ogre children would rarely be born with two heads. It soon became clear that these two-headed ogres were exceptional spellcasters, and their appearance was seen as a good omen.

### Ogre Magus
Ogre magi are smarter, spellcasting versions of ogres, who came into existence in the Second War, when the orc warlock Gul'dan carved up the elven Runestone at Caer Darrow and used its mystic powers to imbue Ogre enforcers with the ability and intelligence to cast spells.

### Ogre Lord
Ogre lords are large, two-headed ogres or ogres in unique armor. Although they do not cast spells, ogre lords make up for their lack of magic with pure brawn, blasting their tree-trunk sized clubs into their enemies' skulls with unequaled fury and force.
