## Satyr
The original Satyrs are the descendants of the kaldorei highborne, the first being Xavius, who allied directly with the Burning Legion during the first invasion ten thousand years before the First War.

***Demonic Power.*** Unlike most Highborne who aided the Legion simply to gain access to more magic, those who would become satyr embraced demonic power for its own sake and swore their allegiance to Xavius.

***Ready to Fight.*** Satyrs are organized only loosely, into a variety of sects. When the alarm sounds, all members of a sect throw themselves into battle. Like all demons, when the Legion calls, they scramble to obey.

They are bloodthirsty, depraved individuals who enjoy slicing open their opponents with curved blades and flinging entrails everywhere.

***Mysterious Heritage.*** Although Satyrs are usually thought of as a race of Demons, some unique Satyrs are classified as Humanoids for inexplicable reasons. It is possible that these Satyrs have, somehow, established a spiritual connection with Azeroth, or that they have severed their bond with their demonic masters.

### Satyr Trickster
Among the satyrs are the tricksters, rogues who distinguish themselves. The tricksters show a certain penchant for painful traps and ambushes and they revere and mimic Lord Xavius' manipulations of his enemies. In battle, they prefer sneaking around their enemies and stabbing them in the back, than risking an open fight.

### Satyr Hellcaller
Many members of the Burning Legion are skilled wielders of fel magic, but the hellcallers are satyr warlocks who, rather than summon demons, manipulate the entropic fire of fel power itself. They are larger and more imposing than the common satyrs. In fight, they stand close to their allies, allowing them to benefit from their spells, while they summon green-yellow flames that immolate flesh and consume life.
