### Scourge Risen Template
A creature risen by the scourge is any Huge or smaller creature brought back to life by vile necromantic energies. A creature that was never flesh and blood to begin with (such as a construct, elemental, ooze, plant, or undead) can't be risen under the scourge's control. The following characteristics change or are added to a creature that becomes a scourge risen creature.

***Retained Characteristics.*** The risen retain its Armor Class, hit points, Hit Dice, Strength, Dexterity, Constitu­tion, vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities.

***Lost Characteristics.*** The risen loses its original saving throw and skill bonuses, special senses, and special traits. It loses any action that isn't multiattack or a melee weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. If it has an action or a melee weapon attack that deals some other type of damage, it loses the ability to deal damage of that type, unless the damage comes from a piece of equipment, such as a magic item.


***Type.*** The risen's type is undead, and it loses any tags.

***Alignment.*** The risen is neutral evil.

***Ability Scores.*** The risen's ability scores change as follows: Int 3 (-4), Wis 6 (-2), Cha 5 (-3).

***Senses.*** The risen has darkvision with a radius of 60 ft.

***Damage Immunities.*** The risen gains immunity to poison damage.

***Condition Immunities.*** poisoned.

***Languages.*** The risen understands all languages it knew in life, but cannot speak.

***Attacks.*** If the risen has no other means of dealing damage, it can use its fists or limbs to make unarmed strikes. On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + the risen's Strength modifier, increasing by 1d4 for each size larger than Medium.

>
> ***Banshee's Curse.*** One creature of the banshee's choice within 60 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on all ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls until the end of the banshee's next turn.
>
> ***Wail (Recharge 4-6).*** The banshee releases a mournful wail. This wail has no effect on constructs and undead.

>
> ***Possession (1/Day).*** One humanoid that the banshee can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the banshee; the banshee then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The banshee now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The banshee can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
> <br>    The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the banshee ends it as a bonus action, or the banshee is turned or forced out by an effect like the *dispel evil and good* spell. When the possession ends, the banshee reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. 
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Anti-magic Shell.*** The banshee adds 3 to its AC against one spell attack that would hit it. To do so, the banshee must see the attacker.
